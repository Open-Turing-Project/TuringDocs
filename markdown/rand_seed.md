# Rand.Seed

## Syntax
**Rand.Seed** (_seed_ : **nat4**, _seq_ : 1 .. 10)

## Description
The **Rand.Seed** procedure restarts one of the sequences generated by **Rand.Next**. Each restart with the same seed causes **Rand.Next** to produce the same sequence for the given sequence.


## Status
Exported qualified.

This means that you can only call the function by calling **Rand.Seed**, not by calling **Seed**.
