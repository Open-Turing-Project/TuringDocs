#randomize

##Syntax
**randomize**



##Description
This procedure is obsolete. It was originally used to produce a different sequence of random numbers each time a program executed. With current versions of Turing, the random number sequence is randomized each time a Turing program is executed, eliminating the need for this procedure.
To reset the random number sequence and thus allow for a predetermined sequence of pseudo-random numbers, use **Rand.Set**.
