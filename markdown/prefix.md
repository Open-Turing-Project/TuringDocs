# prefix

## Syntax
A _prefixOperator_  is one of:   

-  **+**   _% Integer and real identity_       _% (does not change value)_   
-    _% Integer and real negation_   
-  **not**   _% Not (Boolean negation)_   
-  **#**   _% Type cheat_   
-  **^**   _% Pointer following_

## Description
A _prefix operator_ is placed before a value or _operand_ to produce another value. For example, if the value of _x_ is seven, then -_x_ is negative seven. There are also infix operators such as multiplication (*) and addition (+), which are placed between two values to produce a third value. See _infix operator_.

The + and  prefix operators can be applied only to numeric values (integer, real and natural numbers). The **not** prefix can be applied only to true/false (boolean) values. For example **not** (_x_ > _y_)  is equivalent to _x_ <= _y_. The **not** operator produces **true** from **false** and **false** from **true**.

The # operators is a type cheat (see **cheat**), and the ^ operator is pointer following (see **pointer**).


See also   **int**, **real** and **boolean** types, as well as _precedence_ (for the order of applying operators) and _infix operators_.
