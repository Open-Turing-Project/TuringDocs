# intreal

## Syntax
**intreal** ( _i_ : **int** ) : **real**

## Description
The **intreal** function is used to convert an integer to a **real** number. This function is rarely used, because in Turing, an **integer** value can be used where ever a **real** value is required. When the **integer** value is used where a **real** value is required, the **intreal** function is implicitly called to do the conversion from **int** to **real**.
