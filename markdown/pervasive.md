#pervasive

##Description
When a variable, constant, type or subprogram is declared, you can specify that it is to be **pervasive**, which means that it does not need to be explicitly imported into modules, monitors or classes in the current scope. The keyword **pervasive** can be abbreviated as an asterisk (*).


##Example


        var pervasive counter : int % Short form: var * count : int
        const * maxCounter : int := 100
        procedure * p ( x : real )
            Â…
        end p
##Details
