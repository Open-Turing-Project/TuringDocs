#Stream

##Description
This unit contains the predefined subprograms that deal with I/O streams. The basic I/O in Turing is done with I/O statements. However, extra functions are all part of the **Stream **unit.
All routines in the **Stream** unit are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "**Stream.**"), with the exception of **eof** which is part of the language but conceptually part of this unit and is considered to be exported unqualified.
