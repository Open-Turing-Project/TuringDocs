# Concurrency.getpriority

## Syntax
**getpriority : nat**

## Description
The **getpriority** function returns the priority of an executing **process** in a concurrent program.  A smaller value means a faster speed.


## Status
Part of the language and only conceptually part of the **Concurrency** unit. 

This means that you can only call the function by calling **getpriority**, not by calling **Concurrency.getpriority**.
