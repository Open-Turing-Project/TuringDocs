#or

##Syntax
_A _**or**_ B_



##Description
The **or** (boolean) operator yields a result of true if at least one (or both) of the operands is true. **or** is a short circuit operator. For example, if _A_ is true in _A _**or**_ B_ then _B _is not evaluated.



##Example



        var success : boolean := false
        var continuing := true  % the type is boolean
        Â…
        continuing := continuing or success
##Details
_continuing_ is set to **false**, if and only if, both _continuing_ and _success_ are **false**. Since Turing uses short circuit operators, once _continuing_ is true, _success_ will not be looked at.
The **or** operator can be applied to natural numbers. The result is the natural number that is the bit-wise **or** of the operands. See **nat** (natural number).
