#Text.Cls

##Syntax
**Text.Cls**



##Description
The **Text.Cls **(clear screen) procedure is used to blank the screen to the text background color. The cursor is set to the top left (to row 1, column 1).



##Details
The screen should be in a "*screen*" or "*graphics*" mode. If the screen mode has not been set, it will automatically be set to "*screen*" mode. See **View.Set **for details.



##Status
Exported qualified.
This means that you can only call the function by calling **Text.Cls**, not by calling **Cls**.
