#tand

##Syntax
**tand** ( *r* : **real** ) : **real**

##Description
The **tand** function is used to find the tangent of an angle given in degrees. For example, **tand** (45) is 1.

##Example
This program prints out the tangent of 0, 30, 60, 90, up to 360 degrees.
        for i : 0 .. 12
            const angle := i * 30
            put "Tan of ", angle, " is ", tand ( angle )
        end for
##Details
An argument to **tan** of 90, 270, etc. may result in an overflow (and halt of the program) as the result is technically Â¥. (It may not cause an overflow due to rounding, in which case the result will simply be a very large number.)
