# View.ClipOff

## Syntax
**View.ClipOff**

## Description
The **View.ClipOff** procedure turns off clipping. This means that any drawing commands can appear on the entire drawing surface (the screen or the window, depending on the system).

These commands only work in "_graphics_" mode.


## Status
Exported qualified.

This means that you can only call the function by calling **View.ClipOff**, not by calling **ClipOff**.


**See also**   **View.ClipAdd** and **View.ClipSet** functions.
