#natreal

##Syntax
**natreal** ( _n_ : **nat** ) : **real**



##Description
The **natreal** function is used to convert a natural number to a **real** number. This function is rarely used, because in Turing, a natural number can be used anyplace a **real** value is required. When this is done, the **natreal** function is implicitly called to do the conversion from **nat** to **real**. The **natreal** function is similar to **intreal**, except that **natreal** handles values that are larger than **int** values and does not handle negative values.
