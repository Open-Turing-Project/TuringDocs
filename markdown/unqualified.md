##Description
When an identifier _x_ is exported from a module, monitor or class _M_ using the keyword **unqualified**, it can be used outside of M without the qualification "M.". In other words, outside of M, it can be referred to as simply _x_. The keyword **unqualified** can be written in its short form as ~. which is pronounced "not dot", as in:

        export ~. x
