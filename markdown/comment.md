#comment

##Description
A *comment* is a remark to the reader of the program, which the computer ignores. The most common form of comment in Turing starts with a percent sign (%) and continues to the end of the current line; this is called an *end-of-line *comment. There is also the *bracketed *comment, which begins with the /* and ends with */ and which can continue across line boundaries.

##Example

        % This is an end-of-line comment
        var x : real        % Here is another end-of-line comment
        const s := "Hello"
        /* Here is a bracketed comment that
            lasts for two lines */
        const pi := 3.14159
##Details
In the BASIC language, comments are called *remarks *and start with the keyword REM. In Pascal, comments are bracketed by (* and *).
