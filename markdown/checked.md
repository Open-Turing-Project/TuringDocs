#checked

##Description
Unchecked means that certain run time tests, which take place by default, can be eliminated, usually to make the program more efficient at the risk of unreliability. The keyword **checked**, used as a statement, requests that the disabling of checking, previously requested by the keyword **unchecked**, be re-enabled. See **unchecked** for details and an example.
