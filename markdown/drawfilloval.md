#drawfilloval

##Syntax
**drawfilloval** (*x*, *y*, *xRadius*, *yRadius*, *Color* : **int**)

##Description
The **drawfilloval** procedure is used to draw a filled oval whose center is at (*x*, *y*). The horizontal and vertical distances from the center to the oval are given by *xRadius *and *yRadius*. To get an oval outlined in a different color, use **drawfilloval** with the *Color* parameter set to the fill color and then call **drawoval**  with the *Color* parameter set to the border color.

##Example
This program draws a large filled oval that just touches each edge of the screen using color number 1. The **maxx** and **maxy** functions are used to determine the maximum x and y values on the screen. The center of the oval is at (*midx*, *midy*), which is the middle of the screen.
        setscreen ("graphics")
        const midx := maxx div 2
        const midy := maxy div 2
        drawfilloval (midx, midy, midx, midy, 1)
##Details
Ideally, a circle is drawn when *xRadius* = *yRadius*. In fact, the aspect ratio (the ratio of height to width of pixels displayed on the screen) of the IBM PC compatibles is not 1.0, so this does not draw a true circle. In CGA graphics mode this ratio is 5 to 4.
The meaning of the *Color* number depends on the current palette. See the **palette** statement.
The screen should be in a "*graphics*" mode. See the **setscreen** procedure for details. If the screen is not in a "*graphics*" mode, it will automatically be set to "*graphics*" mode.
