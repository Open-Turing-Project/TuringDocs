#Sys.GetEnv

##Syntax
**Sys.GetEnv** ( _symbol_ : **string** ) : **string**


##Description
The **Sys.GetEnv** function is used to access the environment string whose name is _symbol_. These strings are determined by the shell (command processor) or the program that caused your program to run. See also the **Sys.Nargs** and **Sys.FetchArg** functions.


##Example
On a PC, this retrieves the environment variable USERLEVEL and prints extra instructions if USERLEVEL had been set to NOVICE. USERLEVEL can be set to NOVICE with the command **SET USERLEVEL = NOVICE** in the **autoexec.bat** file or in any batch file.

        const userLevel : string
        userLevel := Sys.GetEnv ("USERLEVEL")
            if userLevel = "NOVICE" then
            Â…           % put a set of instructions
        end if
##Status
Exported qualified.

This means that you can only call the function by calling **Sys.GetEnv**, not by calling **GetEnv**.
