#Text.WhatColorBack

##Syntax
**Text.WhatColorBack** : **int**


##Description
The **Text.WhatColorBack** function is used to determine the current text background color. The alternate spelling is **whatcolourback**.


##Example
This program outputs the currently-active background color number. The background color of the message is determined by this number.

        View.Set ("screen")
        Â…
        put "The background of this writing"
        put  "is in color number ", Text.WhatColorBack
##Details
The screen should be in a "_screen_" or "_graphics_" mode. Beware that the meaning of background color is different in these two modes. See **Text.ColorBack** for details.


##Status
Exported qualified.

This means that you can only call the function by calling **Text.WhatColorBack**, not by calling **WhatColorBack**.
