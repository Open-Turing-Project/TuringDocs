#lower

##Syntax
**lower** (_reference_ [ , _dimension_ ] ) : **int**



##Description
The **lower** attribute is used to find the lower bound of an array, string, **char**(_n_) or non-opaque subrange type. Since the lower bound is necessarily known at compile time, **lower** is rarely used.



##See also
**[upper.html](upper)** which finds the [upper.html](upper) bound.
