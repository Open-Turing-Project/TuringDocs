# lower

## Syntax
**lower** (_reference_ [ , _dimension_ ] ) : **int**

## Description
The **lower** attribute is used to find the lower bound of an array, string, **char**(_n_) or non-opaque subrange type. Since the lower bound is necessarily known at compile time, **lower** is rarely used.


## See also
