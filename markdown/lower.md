#lower

##Syntax
**lower** (*reference* [ , *dimension* ] ) : **int**

##Description
The **lower** attribute is used to find the lower bound of an array, string, **char**(*n*) or non-opaque subrange type. Since the lower bound is necessarily known at compile time, **lower** is rarely used.

##See also
**[upper.html](upper)** which finds the [upper.html](upper) bound.
