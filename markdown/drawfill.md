#drawfill

##Syntax
**drawfill** (*x*, *y* : **int**, *fillColor*, *borderColor* : **int**)

##Description
The **drawfill** procedure is used to color in a figure that is on the screen. Starting at (*x*, *y*), the figure is filled with *fillColor* to a surrounding border whose color is *borderColor*.

##Example
This program draws an oval with x and y radius of 10 in the center of the screen using color 1. Then the oval is filled with color 2. The **maxx** and **maxy** functions are used to determine the maximum x and y values on the screen.
        setscreen ("graphics")
        const midx := maxx div 2
        const midy := maxy div 2
        drawoval (midx, midy, 10, 10, 1)
        drawfill (midx, midy, 2, 1)
##Details
The meaning of the *Color* number depends on the current palette; see the **palette** statement.
The screen should be in a "*graphics*" mode. See the **setscreen** procedure for details. If the screen is not in a "*graphics*" mode, it will automatically be set to "*graphics*" mode.
Warning: In Turing for IBM PC compatibles, **drawfill** fails to completely fill in some complicated figures that contain "islands" within them surrounded by the *borderColor*.
