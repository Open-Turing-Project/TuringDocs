#string

##Syntax
A *stringType* is:
Â **string** [ ( *maximumLength* ) ]



##Description
Each variable whose type is a *stringType* can contain a sequence (a string ) of characters. The length of this sequence must not exceed the *stringType'*s maximum length.



##Example



        var name : string
        name := "Nancy"
        var licenceNumber : string ( 6 )
        licenceNumber := "175AJN"
##Details
Strings can be assigned and they can be compared for both equality and for ordering. See also *string comparison *and *assignment statement*.
Strings can be catenated (joined together) using the + operator and separated into substrings. See* catenation *and* substring*. String functions are provided to find the length of a string, to find where one string appears inside another, and to make repeated copies of a string all joined together. See *length*, *index*, and *repeat*.
A string type written without a maximum length is limited to holding a maximum of 255 characters.
The *maximumLength* of a string, if given as a part of the type, must be known at compile time, and must be at least 1 and at most 255. The maximum length of a string is given by *upper*, for example, *upper*(*licenceNumber*) is 6. See also *upper*.
In the declaration of a string that is a **var** formal parameter of a procedure or function, the *maximumLength *can be written as an asterisk (*). Here, the maximum length is taken to be that of the corresponding actual parameter, as in:
The star can also be used when the parameter is an array of strings.


        procedure deblank (var s : string (*) ).
