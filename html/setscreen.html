      <td><b>Description&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td>The <b>setscreen</b> statement is used to change the mode of the 
          screen, as well as the way in which Turing does input and output. 
          The parameter to <b>setscreen</b> is a string, such as "graphics". 
          The string contains one or more options separated by commas, such 
          as "text, noecho".<p>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td><b>Details&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td>Users should look at <b>View.Set</b> in order to find out the 
          implementation specified details of <b>setscreen</b> on their 
          systems.<p>
          There are two screen modes, <b>text</b> and <b>graphics</b>. In 
          <b>text</b> mode, output to the window is only allowed using 
          <b>put</b> and <b>get</b>. Attempting to use graphics or moving 
          the cursor using <b>locate</b> will result in an error. However, 
          a window in <b>text</b> mode will keep all text output sent to it. 
          Any output that scrolls off the edge of the window can be read by 
          adjusting the scroll bars of the window. Printing a <b>text</b> 
          output window prints all the output sent to the window, not just 
          the output currently visible in the window. Programs often use 
          <b>text</b> mode when they are displaying large amounts of text 
          data that the user may wish to view or print later. Saving the 
          contents of a <b>text</b> output window creates a text file 
          containing all the output sent to the window.<p>
	  In <b>graphics</b> mode, a program can use both <b>put</b> and 
	  <b>get</b>, <b>locate</b> and graphics commands to send output 
	  to the window. However, any output that scrolls off the window 
	  is lost. Printing the window outputs the current contents of the 
	  window. Saving a <b>graphics</b> output window saves the current 
	  contents of the window as a BMP file.<p>
	  Where the options to <b>setscreen</b> are mutually exclusive, 
	  they are listed here with the default underlined. Here are the 
	  options:<p>
	  "<b>graphics</b>", "<b>text</b>",  Sets the mode of the 
	  window to the given mode. A size can for the window can be specified 
	  at the same time. If the window mode or size changes, then the 
	  window will be cleared.<p>
	  To specify the size of a window in <b>graphics</b> mode, the 
	  <b>graphics</b> can have a modifier in the form 
	  "graphics:&lt;<i>width</i>&gt;;&lt;<i>height</i>&gt;". This sets 
	  the window to be &lt;<i>width</i>&gt; pixels by &lt;<i>height</i>&gt; 
	  pixels in size. The maximum size of a window is the size of the 
	  screen.<p>
	  To specify the size of a window in <b>text</b> mode, the 
	  <b>text</b> can have a modifier in the form 
	  "text:&lt;<i>rows</i>&gt;;&lt;<i>columns</i>&gt;". This sets the 
	  window to be &lt;<i>rows</i>&gt; text lines in height by 
	  &lt;<i>columns</i>&gt; characters in width. The maximum size of a 
	  window is the size of the screen.<p>
	  To set a window to the maximum size available on the screen, you 
	  can use "max" for the &lt;<i>width</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>height</i>&gt;, 
	  &lt;<i>rows</i>&gt; or &lt;<i>columns</i>&gt; parameters.<p>
	  "<b><u>cursor</u></b>", "<b>nocursor</b>"  Causes the cursor to be shown 
	  (or hidden). The cursor only appears when the program is waiting for 
	  keyboard input from the user.<p>
	  "<b><u>echo</u></b>", "<b>noecho</b>"  Causes (or suppresses) echoing of 
	  characters that are typed. Echoing is commonly turned off in 
	  interactive programs to keep typed characters from being echoed 
	  at inappropriate places on the screen.<p>
	  "<b><u>nooffscreenonly</u></b>", "<b>offscreenonly</b>"  Causes or 
	  (suppresses) output from being sent to the visible window. When the 
	  <b>offscreenonly</b> option is active, any text and graphics output 
	  is drawn to the offscreen buffer that is maintained for every Run 
	  window but not drawn to the screen. <b>View.Update</b> is then 
	  used to copy the entire contents of the offscreen buffer to the 
	  Run window. By allowing numerous drawing commands to be sent to 
	  the offscreen buffer and then updating the window at one time, it 
	  is possible to get smoother animation.<p>
	  "<b>msdos</b>", "<b><u>nomsdos</u></b>"  Causes the window to use the
	  MS-DOS character set (with line drawing characters) instead of the
	  Windows ANSI character set.  The "<b>nomsdos</b>" option causes the
	  window to use the Windows ANSI character set.  Note that the 
	  "<b>msdos</b>" option only works if the Windows font (usually 
	  Courier New) supports it.<p>
	  "<b><u>buttonbar</u></b>", "<b>nobuttonbar</b>"  Causes or (suppresses) 
	  the display of a button bar at the top of the output window which 
	  allows the user to easily stop program execution or save and print 
	  the output window.<p>
