<td> A <i>comment</i> is a remark to the reader of the program, which the computer ignores. The most common form of comment in Turing starts with a percent sign (%) and continues to the end of the current line; this is called an <i>end-of-line </i>comment. There is also the <i>bracketed </i>comment, which begins with the /* and ends with */ and which can continue across line boundaries.<p>
<tr valign="top"><td><b>Example&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>

<pre><tt>        <i>% This is an end-of-line comment</i>
        <b>var</b> x : <b>real</b>        <i>% Here is another end-of-line comment</i>
        <b>const</b> s := "Hello"
        <i>/* Here is a bracketed comment that</i>
            <i>lasts for two lines */</i>
        <b>const</b> <i>pi</i> := 3.14159</tt></pre>
