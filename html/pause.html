<td> The <b>pause</b> statement blocks the program (or just the process in the case of a concurrent program) for a given number of simulated time units. The <i>expn</i> must be a non-negative <b>int</b> value giving the number of time units. This is analogous to the <b>delay</b> statement, which causes blocking for a given amount of real time (actual physical time).<p>
The interpreter maintains a counter which it considers to be simulated time. The only execution that causes this counter to increase is the <b>pause</b> statement. The process executing the <b>pause</b> is blocked until the counter has counted forward the number of units given by <i>expn</i>. All other statements (except <b>wait</b>) are considered to be infinitely fast. Several processes can be executing <b>pause</b> statements simultaneously.<p>
The use of simulated time allows Turing to be used as a simulation language in which the <b>pause</b> statement simulates the passage of time in the simulated system.<p>
