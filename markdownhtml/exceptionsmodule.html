<h1>Exceptions</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This unit contains all the constants corresponding to exception numbers in Turing for use in building exception handlers.</p>

<p>All constants in the Exceptions module are exported unqualified. (This means you can use the constants directly without having to use the qualifier "<strong>Exceptions.</strong>".)</p>
