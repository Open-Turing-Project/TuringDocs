<h1>Pic.Flip</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Pic.Flip</strong> (<em>picID</em> : <strong>int</strong>) : <strong>int</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><strong>Pic.Flip</strong> is used to create a new picture by flipping the picture vertically. The resulting picture is exactly the same size as the original, except it appears &#147;upside-down&#148;.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Note that the upside-down picture is a newly created picture. When it is no longer needed, its memory should be released by using <strong>Pic.Free</strong>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The program loads a picture from a file, flips it and then draws the original and the upside-down image side by side in a window after resizing the window to fit the two pictures.</p>

<p><img src="pic_flip01.gif" alt="Doc image" /></p>

<pre><code>    % Get the original picture
    var pic, newPic, width, height : int
    pic := Pic.FileNew ("lighthouse.jpg")
    newPic := Pic.Flip (pic)
    width := Pic.Width (pic)
    height := Pic.Height (pic)

    % Draw the two images: original and flipped
    View.Set ("graphics:" + intstr (2 * width + 30) + ";" + 
        intstr (height + 25) + ",nobuttonbar")
    Pic.Draw (pic, 10, 20, picCopy)
    Draw.Text ("Original", 50, 5, defFontID, black)
    Pic.Draw (newPic, 20 + Pic.Width (pic), 20, picCopy)
    Draw.Text ("Flipped", 60 + Pic.Width (pic), 5, defFontID, black) 
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.
This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Pic.Flip</strong>, not by calling <strong>Flip</strong>.</p>
