<h1>Stream</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This unit contains the predefined subprograms that deal with I/O streams. The basic I/O in Turing is done with I/O statements. However, extra functions are all part of the <strong>Stream </strong>unit.
All routines in the <strong>Stream</strong> unit are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<strong>Stream.</strong>"), with the exception of <strong>eof</strong> which is part of the language but conceptually part of this unit and is considered to be exported unqualified.</p>

<h2>Entry Points</h2>

<p><a href="**eof**">stream_eof.html</a>* Determines if the end of file has been reached.
<a href="**Flush**">stream_flush.html</a> Flushes a specified stream.
<a href="**FlushAll**">stream_flushall.html</a> Flushes all open output streams.</p>

<ul>
<li>Part of the language, conceptually part of the <strong>Stream</strong> unit.</li>
