<h1>Text.Locate</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Text.Locate</strong> ( <em>row</em>, <em>column</em> : <strong>int</strong> )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>Text.Locate</strong> procedure is used to move the cursor so that the next output from <strong>put</strong> will be at the given row and column. Row 1 is the top of the screen and column 1 is the left side of the screen.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program outputs stars of random colors to random locations on the screen. The variable <em>colr</em> is purposely spelled differently from the word <em>color</em> to avoid the procedure of that name (used to set the color of output). The row number is purposely chosen so that it is one less than <strong>maxrow</strong>. This avoids the scrolling of the screen which occurs when a character is placed in the last column of the last row.</p>

<pre><code>    View.Set ("screen")
    var row, column, colr : int
    loop
        row := Rand.Int (1, maxrow)
        column := Rand.Int (1, maxcol)
        colr := Rand.Int (0, maxcolor)
        Text.Color (colr)
        Text.Locate (row, column )
        put "*" ..  % Use dot-dot to avoid clearing end of line
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The <strong>Text.Locate</strong> procedure is used to locate the next output based on row and column positions. See also the <strong>Text.LocateXY</strong> procedure which is used to locate the output based x and y positions, where x=0, y=0 is the left bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>The screen should be in a "<em>screen</em>" or "<em>graphics</em>" mode. See the <strong>View.Set</strong> procedure for details. If the screen is not in one of these modes, it will automatically be set to"<em>screen</em>" mode.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Text.Locate</strong> , not by calling <strong>Locate</strong>.</p>
