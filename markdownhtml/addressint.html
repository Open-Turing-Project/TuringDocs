<h1>addressint</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>addressint</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>addressint</strong> (address integer) type is an integer type whose range of value is the same as that of the underlying computer. This range is, by its nature, implementation-dependent. On 32-bit architectures, it is commonly the same range as <strong>nat4</strong> (4-byte natural number).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Record <em>r</em> contains three fields, one of which has type <strong>char</strong>(28). Variable <em>a</em> is an integer whose range of values is the same as the addresses of the underlying computer. This assigns <em>B</em> to the seventh character of a record of type <em>r</em> which is assumed to be located at absolute address <em>a</em>.</p>

<pre><code>    type r :
        record
            i : int
            c28 : char (28)
            c11 : char (11)
        end record
    var a : addressint      % An integer
    &#133;                   % a is assigned an integer value
    r @ (a) . c28 (7) := 'B'        % Use indirection operator @
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Although <strong>addressint</strong> is called an integer type, it is commonly equivalent to a natural type such as <strong>nat4</strong> (for 32-bit machines).
Be careful not to confuse <strong>addressint</strong> with pointer types. In low level languages such as assembler and C, addresses and pointers are the same. In Turing, however, a pointer is a high level concept that is more abstract than a machine address. A Turing pointer is a reference to an object, and the representation of this reference depends upon the implementation. In current Turing implementations, pointers (which are by default checked) are represented as a time stamp (a unique number) together with an address. The time stamp is used to make sure that the pointer actually locates an object. There are also <strong>unchecked</strong> pointers. An <strong>unchecked</strong> pointer's internal representation is a machine address. You can use type cheats (a dangerous feature) to translate between <strong>addressint</strong> and unchecked pointers. This is meaningful in current implementations.</p>
