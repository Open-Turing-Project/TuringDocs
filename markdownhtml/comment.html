<h1>comment</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A <em>comment</em> is a remark to the reader of the program, which the computer ignores. The most common form of comment in Turing starts with a percent sign (%) and continues to the end of the current line; this is called an <em>end-of-line</em> comment. There is also the <em>bracketed</em> comment, which begins with the /<em> and ends with </em>/ and which can continue across line boundaries.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    % This is an end-of-line comment
    var x : real        % Here is another end-of-line comment
    const s := "Hello"
    /* Here is a bracketed comment that
        lasts for two lines */
    const pi := 3.14159
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>In the BASIC language, comments are called <em>remarks</em> and start with the keyword REM. In Pascal, comments are bracketed by (<em> and </em>).</p>
