<h1>Net</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Net module allows TCP/IP equipped machines to communicate. In the current implementation (WinOOT 3.0), this is available only under Win32 (Windows 95, 98, NT and later).</p>

<p>To allow two machines to communicate, there must be a server (which calls <strong>Net,WaitForConnection</strong>) and a client (which calls <strong>Net.OpenConnection</strong>). The server waits until a client connects and then starts communication between the two. When a connection is established, a net stream is returned that can be used in the same fashion as a file stream (i.e. using <strong>put</strong>s and <strong>get</strong>s<strong>)</strong>.  Once the connection is finished, the programs call <strong>Net.CloseConnection</strong>.</p>

<p>For ease of reading web pages, the <strong>Net.OpenURLConnection</strong> opens up a URL for reading with the <strong>get</strong> statement. It is up to the user program to interpret the HTML or file located at the URL.</p>

<p>All subprograms in the <strong>Net</strong> unit are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<strong>Net.</strong>").</p>
