<h1>Sprite.Animate</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Sprite.Animate</strong> (<em>spriteID</em>, <em>picID, x</em>, <em>y</em> : <strong>int</strong>,<em>centered</em> : <strong>boolean</strong>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Moves the sprite specified by <em>spriteID</em> to the location specified by (<em>x, y</em>). If <em>centered</em> is <strong>true</strong>, then the sprite is centered on (<em>x, y</em>). Otherwise (<em>x, y</em>) specifies the lower-left corner of the sprite. At the same time, it changes the picture associated with the sprite.
A simple example of the <strong>Sprite.Animate</strong> procedure would be of a man walking. The picture associated with the sprite would constantly change as the figure was walking. At the same time, the location of the figure would also change.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Here is a program that loads a series of images from an animatedGIF file called "mypic.gif".  It works by loading the images fromthe GIF file into an array (see <strong><a href="Pic.FileNewFrames">pic_filenewframes.html</a></strong> formore information) and then displays the images sequentially on the screen, moving the image eight pixels each time.</p>

<pre><code>    var numFrames := Pic.Frames ("mypic.gif")
    % Load the picture
    var delayTime : int
    var pics : array 1 .. numFrames of int
Pic.FileNewFrames ("mypic.gif", pics, delayTime)

    var sprite: int
    sprite:= Sprite.New (pics (1))
    Sprite.SetPosition (sprite, 0, 100, false)
    Sprite.Show (sprite)
    for x : 8 .. maxx by 8
        Sprite.Animate (sprite, pics ((x div 8) mod numFrames + 1), x, 100, false)
        delay (40)    % Stop sprite from moving too quickly
    end for
    Sprite.Free (sprite)
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>
