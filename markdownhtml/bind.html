<h1>bind</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>bindDeclaration</em> is:</p>

<p><strong>bind</strong> [<strong>var</strong>] <em>id</em> <strong>to</strong> <em>variableReference</em>
{ , [<strong>var</strong>] <em>id</em> <strong>to</strong> <em>variableReference</em> }</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>bind</strong> declaration creates a new name (or names) for a variable reference (or references). You are allowed to change the named item only if you specify <strong>var</strong>. You can also bind to named non scalar constants.
While <em>variableReference</em> is bound it does not disappear in the scope.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Rename the <em>n</em>-th element of array <em>A</em> so it is called <em>item</em> and then change this element to 15.</p>

<pre><code>    bind var item to A (n)
    item := 15
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The scope of the identifier (<em>item</em> above) begins with the <strong>bind</strong> declaration and lasts to the <strong>end</strong> of the surrounding program or statement (or to the end of the surrounding part of a <strong>case</strong> or <strong>if</strong> statement). During this scope, a change to a subscript (<em>n</em> above) that occurs in the variable reference does not change the element to which the identifier refers.
You are not allowed to use <strong>bind</strong> at the outermost level of the main program (except nested inside statements such as <strong>if</strong>) or at the outermost level in a module.
You can also optionally use the <strong>register</strong> keyword to request that the bind be done using a machine register. The syntax for <em>bindDeclaration</em> is actually:</p>

<p>{ , [<strong>var</strong>] [<strong>register</strong>] <em>id</em> <strong>to</strong> <em>variableReference</em> }</p>

<p>In the current (2002) implementation, programs are run interpretively using pseudo-code and the <strong>register</strong> keyword is ignored.</p>
