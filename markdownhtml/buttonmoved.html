<h1>buttonmoved</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>buttonmoved</strong> (<em>motion</em> : <strong>string</strong>) : <strong>boolean</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>buttonmoved</strong> function indicates whether there is a mouse event of the appropriate type on the mouse queue. Events are either "up", "down", "updown" or "downup" events (although the "downup" and "updown" are the same event).</p>

<p>The parameter <em>motion</em> must be one of "up", "down", "updown" or "downup". If an event of the type requested is in the queue, <strong>buttonmoved</strong> returns <strong>true</strong>. If the event is not in the queue, then <strong>buttonmoved</strong> returns <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>In "<em>single-button mode</em>" (where the mouse is treated like a one-button mouse), a "down" event occurs whenever all the buttons are up and a button is pressed. An "up" event takes place when the last button is released so that no buttons remain pressed.</p>

<p>In "<em>multi-button mode</em>", a "down" event occurs whenever any button is pressed, and an "up" event occurs whenever any button is released.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program draws random circles on the screen until the user clicks the mouse button, whereupon is starts drawing random boxes. Clicking the mouse button switches between the two.</p>

<pre><code>    var circles: boolean := true
    loop
        var x, y, radius, clr: int
        if buttonmoved ("down") then
            var buttonnumber, buttonupdown : int
            buttonwait ("down", x, y, buttonnumber, buttonupdown)
            circles := not circles
        end if
        randint (x, 0, maxx)
        randint (y, 0, maxy)
        randint (radius, 0, 100)
        randint (clr, 0, maxcolor)
        if circles then
            drawfilloval (x, y, radius, radius, clr)
        else
            drawfillbox (x, y, x + radius, y + radius, clr)
        end if
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This is an example demonstrating how to check for both character and mouse input at the same time.</p>

<pre><code>    var ch : string (1)
    var x, y, btnnum, btnupdown : int
    loop
        if hasch then
            getch (ch)
            locate (1, 1)
            put "The character entered is a: ", ch
        end if
        if buttonmoved ("down") then
            buttonwait ("down", x, y, btnnum, btnupdown)
            locate (1, 1)
            put "The button was clicked at position: ", x, ", ",y
        end if
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p><strong>buttonmoved</strong> can be thought of as the mouse equivalent of <strong>hasch</strong> in that they both check for something in a queue and both return immediately.</p>
