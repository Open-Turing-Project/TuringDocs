<h1>assignment</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>An <em>assignmentStatement</em> is:</p>

<p><em>variableReference</em> := <em>expn</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>An assignment statement calculates the value of the expression (<em>expn</em>) and assigns that value to the variable (<em>variableReference</em>).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var i : int
    i := 24         % Variable i becomes 24
    var a : array 1 .. 25 of string
    a (i) := "Ralph"        % The i-th element of a becomes "Ralph"
    &#133;
    var b : array 1 .. 25 of string
    b := a          % Array b becomes (is assigned) array a
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The expression on the right of := must be <em>assignable</em> to the variable on the left. For example, in the above, any integer value, such as 24, is assignable to <em>i</em>, but a <strong>real</strong> value such as 3.14 would not be not assignable to <em>i</em>. Entire arrays, records and unions can be assigned. For example, in the above, array <em>a</em> is assigned to array <em>b</em>. See <em>assignability</em> for the exact rules of allowed assignments.
You cannot assign a new value to a constant (<strong>const</strong>).
There are short forms that allow you to write assignment statements more compactly. For example,</p>

<p>can be shortened to</p>

<p>In Turing, there are short forms for combining +, = and * with assignment. For example, <em>i</em> *= 2 doubles <em>i</em>.
There are also short forms to allow any binary operator to be combined with assignment. For example, <em>i</em> <strong>shl</strong>= 2 shifts <em>i</em> by 2 to the left.</p>
