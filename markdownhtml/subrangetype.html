<h1>subrangeType</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>subrangeType</em> is:   <em>expn</em> .. <em>expn</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A subrange type defines a set of values, for example, the subrange 1 .. 4 consists of 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var i : 1 .. 10         % i can be 1, 2 &#133; up to 10
    type xRange : 0 .. 319      % Define integer subrange
    var pixels : array xRange of int
                        % Array elements are
                        % numbered 0, 1, &#133; 319
    for k : xRange          % k ranges from 0 to 319
        pixels ( k ) := 0
    end for
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A subrange must contain at least one element. In other words, the second expression (<em>expn</em>) must be at least as large as the first expression.</p>

<p>The lower bound of a subrange must be known at compile time. The upper bound is allowed to be a run time value only in one situation and that is when it gives the upper bound of an array being declared in a variable declaration, in other words when declaring a <em>dynamic</em> array.</p>

<p>Subranges are usually a subset of the integers, as in 1 .. 10. You can also have subranges of enumerated types and characters (the <strong>char</strong> type).</p>

<p>You can apply <strong>lower</strong> and <strong>upper</strong> to subrange types.</p>
