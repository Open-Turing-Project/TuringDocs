<h1>checked</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Unchecked means that certain run time tests, which take place by default, can be eliminated, usually to make the program more efficient at the risk of unreliability. The keyword <strong>checked</strong>, used as a statement, requests that the disabling of checking, previously requested by the keyword <strong>unchecked</strong>, be re-enabled. See <strong>unchecked</strong> for details and an example.</p>
