<h1>char</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>char</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Each variable whose type is a <strong>char</strong> contains a single character, such as the letter <em>A</em>, the digit <em>3</em> or the special character &amp;.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Count characters until a period is found. Character <em>c</em> is read using a <strong>get</strong> statement and is compared to the explicit character constant '.'.</p>

<pre><code>    var c : char
    var counter := 0
    loop
        exit when eof
        get c           % Read a single character
        exit when c = '.'   % Single quotes for char constant
        counter := counter + 1
    end loop
    put counter, " characters before the period"
</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Count capital letters. This example illustrates the use of the <strong>char</strong> type as the subscript type for the <em>frequency</em> array, the use of character variable <em>c</em> as a subscript, and the use of <em>d</em> as a <strong>for</strong> counter that ranges across the letters A to Z.</p>

<pre><code>    var frequency : array 'A' .. 'Z' of nat
    for d : 'A' .. 'Z'
        frequency (d) := 0
    end for
    loop                % Tabulate use of capital letters
        exit when eof
        var c : char
        get c           % Read one character
        if c &gt;= 'A' and c &lt;= 'Z' then
            frequency (c) := frequency (c) + 1
        end if
    end loop
    for d : 'A' .. 'Z'      % Print frequency of capital letters
        put d, " ", frequency (d)
    end for
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The type <strong>string</strong> (or <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>)) is used instead of <strong>char</strong> when more than one character needs to be stored, such as the string of characters <em>Henry</em>. Unless the program needs to be quite efficient, it is usually easier to use the <strong>string</strong> type. See also the <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>) type, which always stores exactly <em>n</em> characters.
The <strong>char</strong> type differs from the <strong>string</strong>(1) type in the following way: <strong>char</strong> always represents exactly one character, while <strong>string</strong>(1) can represent either the null string or a string containing one character. The <strong>char</strong> type is similar to the <strong>char</strong>(1) type in that both contain at most one character.
The <strong>char</strong> type is an index type and can be used, for example, as subscripts, <strong>for</strong> ranges and <strong>case</strong> labels. For example, this declaration</p>

<p>creates an array whose subscripts are characters.
The <strong>char</strong> type is a scalar type, which implies that its parameters are passed by value, instead of by reference (which is the case for <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>) and <strong>string</strong>).
Values of the <strong>char</strong> type can be assigned and they can be compared for both equality and ordering. Explicit <strong>char</strong> constants are written as a character surrounded by single quotes, for example, 'A'. For details, including how to write control characters, see <em>explicitCharConstant</em>.
Characters can be read and written by <strong>get</strong> and <strong>put</strong> statements.
There are 256 <strong>char</strong> values, corresponding to the distinct patterns in an 8-bit byte. This allows the patterns <em>eos</em> (internal value 0) and <em>uninitchar</em> (internal value 128) to be <strong>char</strong> values (these patterns are not allowed in the <strong>string</strong> type; see the <strong>string</strong> type). All 256 patterns are used, so there is no pattern left to be the "uninitialized value". Uninitialized checking is not done for the <strong>char</strong> type.
The <strong>ord</strong> and <strong>chr</strong> functions convert between the <strong>char</strong> values and their corresponding numeric representation in a byte. See <strong>ord</strong> and <strong>chr</strong>.
In general, you can freely intermix the values of the types <strong>char</strong>, <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>) and <strong>string</strong>. This means that catenation (+), comparisons, <strong>length</strong> and substrings can be applied to any of these types. See <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>) for details about conversions between <strong>char</strong>, <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>) and <strong>string</strong>.</p>
