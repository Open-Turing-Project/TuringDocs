<h1>token</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A <em>token</em> is essentially a word, a number or a special symbol such as :=. In a Turing program there are four kinds of tokens: keywords such as <strong>get</strong>, identifiers such as <em>incomeTax</em>, operators and special symbols, such as <strong>+</strong> and :=, and explicit constants, such as 1.5 and "Hello". Some keywords, such as <strong>index</strong>, are reserved and cannot be used in programs to name variables, procedures, etc.
A <strong>get</strong> statement, such as
uses <em>token-oriented</em> input. This means that white space (blanks, tabs, etc.) is skipped before reading the input item and after the item (up to the beginning of the next line). See the <strong>get</strong> statement for details.</p>

<pre><code>    get incomeTax
</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In this example, the tokens are <strong>var</strong>, <em>x</em>, :, <strong>real</strong>, <em>x</em>, := and 9.84.</p>

<pre><code>    var x : real
    x := 9.84
</code></pre>
