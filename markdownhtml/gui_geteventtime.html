<h1>GUI.GetEventTime</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>GUI.GetEventTime</strong> : <strong>int</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Returns the time in milliseconds when the event (mouse button or keystroke) took place. This value is the same value as <em>Time.Elapsed</em> returns if called when the event was processed. This function should only be called in an <em>action procedure</em> or in a default mouse, keystroke, or null event handler, as it will return 1 when there is no event being processed.</p>

<p>This event can be used as a timer for various functions such as determining whether a single click or a double click of the mouse button took place or for timing keyboard input.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following program times the interval between two button presses.</p>

<pre><code>    import GUI in "%oot/lib/GUI" 
    View.Set ("graphics:300;100") 

    var startTime, startButton, finishButton : int

    procedure Start
        startTime := GUI.GetEventTime
    end Start

    procedure Finish
        Text.Locate (1, 1)
        put "The time between button pressed is ", 
            GUI.GetEventTime  startTime, " msecs"
        GUI.Quit
    end Finish

    startButton := GUI.CreateButton (10, 10, 110, "Click First", Start)
    finishButton := GUI.CreateButton (180, 10, 110, "Click Second", Finish)

    loop
        exit when GUI.ProcessEvent
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>GUI.GetEventTime</strong> , not by calling <strong>GetEventTime</strong> .</p>
