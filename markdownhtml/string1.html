<h1>string</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>stringType</em> is:   <strong>string</strong> [ ( <em>maximumLength</em> ) ]</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Each variable whose type is a <em>stringType</em> can contain a sequence (a string ) of characters. The length of this sequence must not exceed the <em>stringType'</em>s maximum length.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var name : string
    name := "Nancy"
    var licenceNumber : string ( 6 )
    licenceNumber := "175AJN"
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Strings can be assigned and they can be compared for both equality and for ordering. See also <em>string comparison</em> and <em>assignment statement</em>.</p>

<p>Strings can be catenated (joined together) using the + operator and separated into substrings. See <em>catenation</em> and <em>substring</em>. String functions are provided to find the length of a string, to find where one string appears inside another, and to make repeated copies of a string all joined together. See <em>length</em>, <em>index</em>, and <em>repeat</em>.</p>

<p>A string type written without a maximum length is limited to holding a maximum of 255 characters.</p>

<p>The <em>maximumLength</em> of a string, if given as a part of the type, must be known at compile time, and must be at least 1 and at most 255. The maximum length of a string is given by <em>upper</em>, for example, <em>upper</em>(<em>licenceNumber</em>) is 6. See also <em>upper</em>.</p>

<p>In the declaration of a string that is a <strong>var</strong> formal parameter of a procedure or function, the <em>maximumLength</em> can be written as an asterisk (*). Here, the maximum length is taken to be that of the corresponding actual parameter, as in:</p>

<p>The star can also be used when the parameter is an array of strings.</p>

<pre><code>    procedure deblank (var s : string (*) ).
</code></pre>
