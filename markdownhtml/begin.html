<h1>begin</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>beginStatement</em> is:</p>

<p><strong>begin</strong>
<em>statementsAndDeclarations</em>
<strong>end</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A <strong>begin</strong> statement limits the scope of declarations made within it to the confines of the <strong>begin/end</strong> block. In Turing, <strong>begin</strong> is rarely used, because declarations can appear wherever statements can appear, and because every structured statement such as <strong>if</strong> ends with an explicit <strong>end</strong>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    begin
        var bigArray : array 1 .. 2000 of real
        &#133; bigArray will exist only inside this begin statement&#133;
    end
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>In Pascal programs, <strong>begin</strong> statements are quite common because they are required for grouping two or more statements, for example, to group the statements that follow <strong>then</strong>. This is not necessary in Turing as where ever you can write a single statement, you can also write several statements.</p>
