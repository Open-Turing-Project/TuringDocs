<h1>GUI.GetEventWindow</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>GUI.GetEventWindow</strong> : <strong>int</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Returns the window ID of the window in which the event (mouse button or keystroke) took place. This function should only be called in an <em>action procedure</em> or in a default mouse or keystroke event handler, as it will return 1 when there is no event being processed.</p>

<p>This function is commonly used when several windows share the same layout. The same buttons in each window point to the same <em>action procedures</em>. To determine which button was actually pressed, the function is called to get the window.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following program creates four windows in a row, each with a button that, when pressed, causes a star to be drawn in that window.</p>

<pre><code>    import GUI in "%oot/lib/GUI" 

    procedure DrawStar
        var windowID : int := GUI.GetEventWindow
        Window.Select (windowID)
        Draw.FillStar (25, 40, 175, 190, Rand.Int (10, 15))
    end DrawStar

    for i : 0 .. 3
        var window : int := Window.Open ("graphics:200;200") 
        % Place window above task bar, across from previous one.
        Window.SetPosition (window, 220 * i, 27) 
        var button : int := GUI.CreateButton (5, 5, 190, "Draw Star", 
            DrawStar) 
    end for

    loop
        exit when GUI.ProcessEvent
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>GUI.GetEventWindow</strong>, not by calling <strong>GetEventWindow</strong>.</p>
