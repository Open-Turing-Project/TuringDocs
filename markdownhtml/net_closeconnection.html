<h1>Net.CloseConnection</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Net.CloseConnection</strong> (<em>netStream</em> : <strong>int</strong>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Closes a network connection made with <strong>Net.OpenConnection</strong> or <strong>Net.WaitForConnection</strong>. After the connection is closed, the net stream cannot be used for any purpose on either side of the connection.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The <strong>Net</strong> module requires a TCP/IP stack to be installed and operating in order to function. It does not communicate using any other protocols
It is possible for Firewalls to interfere with the actions of the <strong>Net</strong> module, preventing connections from taking place.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following program fragment connects to port 5300 on the machine specified by <em>netAddress</em>, sends the work OK to it and closes the connection.</p>

<pre><code>    netStream := Net.OpenConnection (netAddress, chatPort)
    if netStream &lt;= 0 then
        put "Unable to connect to ", netAddress
        return
    end if
    put : netStream, "OK"
    Net.CloseConnection (netStream)
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.
This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Net.CloseConnection</strong>, not by calling <strong>CloseConnection</strong>.</p>
