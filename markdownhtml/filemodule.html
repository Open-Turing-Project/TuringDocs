<h1>File</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This unit contains the predefined subprograms that deal with file manipulation on a whole-file basis (as opposed to manipulating the data in the file using <strong>open</strong> and <strong>close</strong>, etc.). These routines allow you to rename, copy and delete files, as well as get information about a file and get the free space on disk available for a file.</p>

<p>All routines in the File module are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<strong>File.</strong>").</p>

<h2>Entry Points</h2>

<p><a href="file_exists.html"><strong>Exists</strong></a>   Returns whether a file exists.
<a href="file_fullpath.html"><strong>FullPath</strong></a>   Returns the full absolute path name of a file.
<a href="file_parent.html"><strong>Parent</strong></a>   Returns the parent directory of a file or directory.
<a href="file_status.html"><strong>Status</strong></a>   Gets information about a file such as size, modification date, etc.
<a href="file_copy.html"><strong>Copy</strong></a>   Copies a file to another location.
<a href="file_rename.html"><strong>Rename</strong></a>   Renames a file or directory.
<a href="file_delete.html"><strong>Delete</strong></a>   Deletes a file.
<a href="file_diskfree.html"><strong>DiskFree</strong></a>   Gets the free space on the disk upon which a file or directory resides.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>On the PC, a path name of a file or a directory can use either the forward slash or backward slash to separate directory names. The drive must be followed by a colon. Thus the following are legal path names:</p>

<p>On the Macintosh, a path name of a file or directory can use the standard Macintosh format of Volume Name:Directory Name:Directory Name:File Name or the Unix format of /Volume Name/Directory Name/Directory Name/File Name.  Note that the names can have spaces in them.</p>

<p>On UNIX systems, the path name must correspond to the UNIX standard of using a forward slash between parts of the path.</p>

<p>In general, you can achieve the greatest portability by using the UNIX standard for use in path names, as all Turing systems support it.</p>

<pre><code>    x:\students\west\example.t
    c:/turing/test.t
    /west/binary.t  (uses the default drive).
            HSA:Applications:Turing Files:example.t
    /HSA/Applications/Turing Files/example.t
            /export/home/west/turing/example.t
</code></pre>
