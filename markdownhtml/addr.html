<h1>addr</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>addr</strong> (<em>reference</em>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>addr</strong> attribute is used to find the integer address of a variable or non scalar constant. This is implementation-dependent. This address may be used in an indirection operation <strong>@</strong>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Set <em>a</em> to be the address of <em>x</em>.</p>

<pre><code>    var x : real
    var a : addressint := addr (x)
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The value of the address produced by <strong>addr</strong> is of type <strong>addressint</strong>, an integer type whose range is that of the underlying memory addresses.</p>

<p>The concept of an address is implementation-dependent. For example, an optimizing compiler could determine that a variable does not require space because the program could be computed without the variable with no change in output. However, in most implementations, types have a predictable size and variables of that type occupy that number of bytes in memory.</p>
