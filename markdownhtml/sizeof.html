<h1>sizeof</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>sizeof</strong> (<em>typeNameOrVariableReference</em>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>sizeof</strong> attribute is used to find the number of bytes used to represent the type or variable. This is implementation-dependent (dirty).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The size of <strong>int2</strong> and <strong>nat2</strong> is 2.</p>

<pre><code>    var i : int2
    const nat2size := sizeof ( i )  % size is 2
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The <em>typeNameOrVariableReference</em> must be the name of a user-defined type, a variable reference, a basic type (such as <strong>real</strong>), or a constant.
In principle, <strong>sizeof</strong> returns the number of <em>storage units</em> which would not necessarily be 8-bit bytes. For example, in some older machines, such as the CDC 6000 series, the storage units are 60 bit words. However, almost all modern computers use 8-bit bytes so these are the units of <strong>sizeof</strong>.
Beware that sizes may reflect alignment constraints in the underlying computer. For example, string sizes may be rounded up to even values (2-byte word alignments).</p>
