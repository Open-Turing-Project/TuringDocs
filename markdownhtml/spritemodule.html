<h1>Sprite</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Sprites are a way of doing animation in Turing bypassing the <strong>Pic</strong> module. A sprite is essentially a picture with a specific location and "depth". You create a sprite by calling <strong>Sprite.New</strong> with a picID received from <strong>Pic.New</strong>. You can then move the sprite around by calling <strong>Sprite.SetPosition</strong>. When you are finished with the sprite, you call <strong>Sprite.Free</strong>.</p>

<p>Note that sprites work best when they are moderately small. If you have large sprites, you will continue to have flashing.</p>

<p>All subprograms in the <strong>Sprite</strong> unit are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<strong>Sprite.</strong>").</p>
