<h1>explicitIntegerConstant</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>An <em>explicitIntegerConstant</em> is a sequence of one or more decimal digits (0 to 9) optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign. This is an alternate form that specifies a number base (such as base 2 or base 16).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In the following, the explicit integer constants are 0, 115 and 5.</p>

<pre><code>    var count : int := 0
    const height := 115
    &#133;
    count := height - 5
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>In current implementations of Turing, the range of the <strong>int</strong> (<strong>integer</strong>) type is from -2147483647 to 2147483647. In other words, the maximum size of integer is 2<strong>31 - 1. This is the range that fits into four bytes, with one pattern left over (the largest negative 4-byte number) to represent the uninitialized value. See </strong>maxint**.</p>

<p>Values can be written in base 2 or 16 or any other base in the range 2 to 36 (36 because there are 10 digits and 26 letters). This form begins with the base, such as 16, then #, and then the value written in that base, for example, 16#A has the value 10. The letters a, b, c &#133; represent the digit values 10, 11, 12 &#133; Capital letters A, B, C &#133; can be used instead of lower case. Here are some examples.</p>

<p>2#1     = 1     (Base 2)
2#11     = 3     (Base 2)
16#a     = 10     (Base 16)
16#FF     = 255     (Base 16)
16#FFFF   = 32767   (Base 16)
8#10     = 8     (Base 8)</p>

<p>Here is an example of using these:</p>

<p>You should be careful to avoid confusion about patterns such as 16#FFFF. It is tempting to think that this is the value 1, because the bit pattern (2-byte two's complement internal representation) for 1 is the same as the bit pattern for 16#FFFF = 32767. However, the value (as opposed to the internal representation) of 1 and 32767 are different.</p>

<pre><code>    const maxnat1 := 16#FF      % Largest 1-byte natural number
    const maxint2 := 16#7FFF    % Largest 2-byte integer
</code></pre>
