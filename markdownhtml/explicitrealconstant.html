<h1>explicitRealConstant</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>An <em>explicitRealConstant</em> consists of an optional plus or minus sign, a <em>significant digits part</em>, and an <em>exponent part</em>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In the following, the explicit real constants are 0.0 and 2.93e3.</p>

<pre><code>    var temperature : real := 0.0
    const speed := 2.93e3       % Value is 2,930.0
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The significant digits part (or <em>fractional part</em>) of an explicit real constant consists of a sequence of one or more digits (0 to 9) optionally containing a decimal point (a period). The decimal point is allowed to follow the last digit as in 16. or to precede the first digit, as in .25.</p>

<p>The exponent part consists of the letter <em>e</em> or <em>E</em> followed optionally by a plus or minus sign followed by one or more digits. For example, in -9.837e-3 the exponent part is e-3. The value of -9.837e-3 is -9.837 times 0.001.</p>

<p>If the significant figures part contains a decimal point, then the exponent part is not required.</p>
