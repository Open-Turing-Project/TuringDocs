<h1>explicitCharConstant</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>An <em>explicitCharConstant</em> is a sequence of characters surrounded by single quotation marks, for example, 'Renzo'.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In the following, the explicit character constants are 'H' and 'Hi'.</p>

<pre><code>    var c : char := 'H'
    var d : char (2) := 'Hi'
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>An explicit character constant must contain at least one character. If it contains exactly one character, as in 'A', its type is <strong>char</strong>. If it contains two or more characters (<em>n</em> characters), as 'Width', its type is <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>). The difference between the <strong>char</strong> and <strong>char</strong>(1) types is rarely of significance, but does make a difference in declarations without an explicit type, for example:</p>

<p>The backslash \ is used in explicit string and char(n) constants to specify special values, for example, '\T' is the tab character. Similarly, the carat ^ is used to specify ASCII control characters, for example, '<sup>H'</sup> is the ASCII backspace. See <em>explicitStringConstants</em> for details.</p>

<p>Explicit character constants cannot cross line boundaries. To represent a constant that is longer than a line, break it into two or more strings on separate lines and use + (catenation) to join the individual strings. See <strong>catenation</strong>.</p>

<p>An explicit character constant may be limited in length by the implementation. We recommend that this limitation be at least 32767.</p>

<p>Explicit character constants, but not strings, are allowed to contain the character internal values 0 (called <em>eos</em> for end of string) and 128 (called <em>uninitchar</em>, used as the uninitialized string value).</p>

<pre><code>    var c := 'H'        % Type is char
    var d := 'Hi'   % Type is char (2)
    var e := "H"    % Type is string
</code></pre>
