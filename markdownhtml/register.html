<h1>register</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When a variable, constant or parameter is declared, you can request that the item be placed in a machine register. This should be done only for programs requiring considerable efficiency.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var register counter : int
    const register maxCounter : int := 100
    procedure p ( register x : real )
        &#133;
    end p
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Items can be requested to be in registers only if they are local to a subprogram (not global variables, declared in the main program, a module, monitor or class). Items requested to be in registers cannot be bound to, passed to reference parameters, have their address taken by <strong>addr</strong>, or  have certain type cheats applied to them (since a machine register has no address).</p>

<p>The request to use a register may be ignored. For example, the current (1999) interpretive implementation uses pseudo-code, which has no machine registers, and so ignores the <strong>register</strong> keyword. For the syntax of using this keyword, see <strong>var</strong> declaration, <strong>const</strong> declaration and <strong>paramDeclaration</strong>.</p>
