<h1>playdone</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>playdone</strong> : <strong>boolean</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program sounds the first three notes of the C scale and outputs "All done" as soon as they are finished. Without the loop, the message would come out before the notes are finished.</p>

<pre><code>    play ( "cde" )
    loop
        exit when playdone
    end loop
    put "All done"
</code></pre>
