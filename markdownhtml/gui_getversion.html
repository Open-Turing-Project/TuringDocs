<h1>GUI.GetVersion</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>GUI.GetVersion</strong> : <strong>int</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Returns the current version of the GUI Procedure Library. Because the GUI Procedure Library is expected to grow, new versions will probably be made available at our web site <strong>http://www.holtsoft.com/turing</strong>. If you wish to use features that do not appear in earlier versions of the library, you can have your program check that the current available version meets the programs needs. <strong>GUI.GetVersion</strong> returns an integer from 100 - 999 and is read as 1.00 to 9.99.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following program fragment immediately exits if OOT does not support version 1.1 of the GUI Procedure Library</p>

<pre><code>    import GUI in "%oot/lib/GUI"
    if GUI.GetVersion &lt; 110 then
        put "You must update to at least version 1.1 of the"
        put "GUI Procedure Library to use this program."
        return
    end if
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>In version 1.00 (shipped with MacOOT 1.5), <strong>GUI.GetVersion</strong> did not exist.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.
This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>GUI.GetVersion</strong>, not by calling <strong>GetVersion</strong>.</p>
