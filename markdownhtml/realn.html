<h1>realn</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>(a)<strong>real4</strong>  <em>% 4-byte real number</em>
(b)<strong>real8</strong>  <em>% 8-byte real number</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>real_n_</strong> (<em>n</em>-byte real number) types are machine-dependent types that occupy a specified number of bytes. By contrast, the <strong>real</strong> type is, in principle, a machine-independent and mathematical type (however, it overflows when the exponent of the value is too large or small and it has only a limited amount of precision).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var width : real4
    var height : real8
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Turing implements the type <strong>real</strong>  using 8 byte floating point representation. This provides 14 to 16 decimal digits of precision and an exponent range of at least -38 .. 38. The PC and Macintosh versions of Turing have 16 decimal digits of accuracy because they use IEEE standard floating point representation.
This implies that <strong>real8</strong> and <strong>real</strong> are essentially the same type, so in practice there is no advantage to using <strong>real8</strong> rather than <strong>real</strong>. However, <strong>real4</strong> has the advantage of occupying half as much space (with correspondingly reduced precision).
Arithmetic for all real types (<strong>real</strong>, <strong>real4</strong> and <strong>real8</strong>) is carried out with the accuracy and exponent range of 8-byte reals.
The type <strong>real4</strong> is sometimes called <em>single precision</em> (because it occupies a single 4-byte word) and <strong>real8</strong> is sometimes called <em>double precision</em>.</p>
