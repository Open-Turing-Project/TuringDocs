<h1>real</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>real</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>real</strong> number type is used for numbers that have fractional parts, for example, 3.14159. Real numbers can be combined by various operators such as addition (+) and multiplication (*). Real numbers can also be combined with integers (whole numbers, such as 23, 0 and -9), in which case the result is generally a real number. An integer can always be assigned to a real variable, with implicit conversion to <strong>real</strong>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var weight, x : real
    var x : real := 9.83
    var tax := 0.7      % The type is implicitly real because
                    % 0.7 is a real number
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>See also <em>explicitRealConstant</em>. The <strong>int</strong> type is used instead of <strong>real</strong>, when values are whole numbers. See <strong>int</strong> for details.
Real numbers can be converted to integers using <strong>ceil</strong> (ceiling), <strong>floor</strong>, or <strong>round</strong>. Real numbers can be converted to strings using <strong>erealstr</strong>, <strong>frealstr</strong>, and <strong>realstr</strong>. These conversion functions correspond exactly to the formatting used for the <strong>put</strong> statement with real numbers. Strings can be converted to real numbers using <strong>strreal</strong>. See descriptions of these conversion functions.
The predefined functions for real numbers include <strong>min</strong>, <strong>max</strong>, <strong>sqrt</strong>, <strong>sin</strong>, <strong>cons</strong>, <strong>arctan</strong>, <strong>sind</strong>, <strong>cosd</strong>, <strong>arcand</strong>, <strong>ln</strong> and <strong>exp</strong>. See the descriptions of these functions.
Pseudo-random sequences of real numbers can be generated using <strong>rand</strong>. See the description of this procedure.
The Turing Report gives a formal definition (not repeated here) of implemented real numbers in terms of their required accuracy relative to infinitely accurate (mathematical) real numbers.
Turing implements real numbers using 8 byte floating point representation. This provides 14 to 16 decimal digits of precision and an exponent range of at least -38 .. 38. The PC and Macintosh versions of Turing have 16 decimal digits of accuracy because they use IEEE standard floating point representation.</p>
