<h1>objectclass</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>objectclass</strong> ( <em>pointerExpn</em> )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>objectclass</strong> attribute is used to find the class of an object located by a pointer. The <em>pointerExpn</em> must be an expression that is a pointer to a class.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>See <strong>class</strong> for an example of classes and inheritance, in which a class called <em>TextFile</em> is inherited by a class called <em>Device</em>. The <em>Device</em> class adds a new exported procedure called <em>ioCtl</em>. In the present example, <strong>objectclass</strong> is used to test to make sure that the <em>textFilePtr</em> currently locates an object that was created as a <em>Device</em> (or as a descendant of <em>Device</em>). The notation <em>Device(textFilePtr)</em> converts the pointer to be a pointer to a <em>Device</em> so that <em>ioCtl</em> can be called.</p>

<pre><code>    var textFilePtr : ^ TextFile
    &#133;
    if objectclass ( textFilePtr ) &gt;= Device then
        % Can safely treat object as a Device
        Device ( textFilePtr ) . ioCtl
        &#133;
    end if
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>This example uses the class comparison operator >= which means "is a descendant of". See <strong>class</strong>.</p>

<p>You can only use <strong>objectclass</strong>  in class comparisons. In particular, <strong>objectclass</strong> cannot be used to declare pointers. For example, this:</p>

<p>is not allowed.</p>

<pre><code>    var p : ^objectclass (q)
</code></pre>
