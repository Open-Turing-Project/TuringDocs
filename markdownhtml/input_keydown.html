<h1>Input.KeyDown</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Input.KeyDown</strong> (<strong>var</strong> <em>chars</em> : <strong>array char of boolean</strong>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>Input.Keydown</strong> procedure allows a program to read which keys are currently being pressed. This procedure is different from <strong>getch</strong> in that it allows a program to detect when a user presses and releases a button. As such, it is not to be used in conjunction with <strong>getch</strong>.</p>

<p>The procedure can be used in games where an action takes place while a key is depressed.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Determine if the T key is pressed. Note that we check for the lower case letter.</p>

<pre><code>    var chars : array char of boolean
    Input.KeyDown (chars)
    if chars ('t') then
        put "The T key is pressed"
    end if
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The array returned is a list of all the characters. A key is currently pressed if the array element with the corresponding character is <strong>true.</strong> For example, the <em>a</em> key is pressed is <em>chars</em> ('a') is <strong>true</strong>. Note that each key is individually represented, so if the user has pressed Shift+a to get a 'A', then <strong>Input.KeyDown</strong> would register Shift and 'a' as pressed, but not 'A'.</p>

<p>A full list of all the possible characters that can be set with Input.KeyDown can be found in the <strong>Key Codes</strong> appendix.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The number of keys that can be pressed simultaneously is hardware dependent. Most keyboards can detect a minimum of two keys + Shift + Control + Alt. This means that if you are designing a two player game to be played at a single keyboard and you wish to make certain that players cannot &#147;hog the keyboard&#148; by holding down keys, you should not use more than 6 different keys and three of them should be the Shift, Control and Alt keys.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The program reads the keyboard and displays a message while the arrow keys are pressed. It can detect up to all four arrow keys pressed at once.</p>

<pre><code>    var chars : array char of boolean
    loop
        Input.KeyDown (chars)
        locate (1, 1)
        if chars (KEY_UP_ARROW) then
            put "Up Arrow Pressed  " ..
        else
            put "                  " ..
        end if
        if chars (KEY_RIGHT_ARROW) then
            put "Right Arrow Pressed  " ..
        else
            put "                     " ..
        end if
        if chars (KEY_LEFT_ARROW) then
            put "Left Arrow Pressed  " ..
        else
            put "                    " ..
        end if
        if chars (KEY_DOWN_ARROW) then
            put "Down Arrow Pressed  " ..
        else
            put "                  " ..
        end if
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Another example is available that checks for all possible keys.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Input.KeyDown</strong>, not by calling <strong>KeyDown</strong>.</p>
