<h1>Concurrency.simutime</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>simutime</strong> : <strong>int</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>simutime</strong> function returns the number of simulated time units that have passed since program execution began.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Simulated time only passes when all process are either paused or waiting. This simulates the fact that CPU time is effectively infinitely faster than "pause" time.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This prints out the simulated time passing between two processes. This will print out <em>3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 15, 18, 20, 21, ...</em></p>

<pre><code>    process p (t : int)
        loop
            pause t
            put simutime
        end loop
    end p

    fork p (3)
    fork p (5)
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported unqualified.
This means that you can call the function by calling <strong>simutime</strong> or by calling <strong>Concurrency.simutime</strong>.</p>
