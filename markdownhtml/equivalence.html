<h1>equivalence</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Two types are <em>equivalent</em> to each other if they are essentially the same types (the exact rules are given below). When a variable is passed to a <strong>var</strong> formal parameter, the types of the variable and the formal parameter must be equivalent because they are effectively the same variable. When an expression is assigned to a variable, their types must be equivalent, except for special cases. For example, Turing allows you to assign an integer expression to a <strong>real</strong> variable (see <em>assignability</em> for details).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var j : int

    var b : array 1 .. 25 of string

    type personType :
        record
            age : int
            name : string (20)
        end record

    procedure p (var i : int, var a : array 1 .. 25 of string,
                var r : personType)
    &#133; body of procedure p, which modifies each of i, a and r &#133;
    end p

    var s : personType
    p (j, b, s)     % Procedure call to p
                % i and j have the equivalent type int
                % Arrays a and b have equivalent types
                % Records r and s have equivalent types
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Two types are defined to be <em>equivalent</em> if they are:</p>

<ul>
<li> the same standard type (<strong>int</strong>, <strong>real</strong>, <strong>boolean</strong> or <strong>string</strong>),</li>
<li> subranges with equal first and last values,</li>
<li> arrays with equivalent index types and equivalent component types,</li>
<li> strings with equal maximum lengths,</li>
<li> sets with equivalent base types, or</li>
<li>  pointers to the same collection; in addition,</li>
<li> a declared type identifier is also equivalent to the type it names (and to the type named by that type, if that type is a named type, etc.)</li>
<li> both <strong>char</strong>,</li>
<li> both <strong>char</strong>(<em>n</em>) with the same length,</li>
<li> both procedure types, with corresponding equivalent parameter types and corresponding <strong>var</strong> or non-<strong>var</strong> of the parameters,</li>
<li> both function types, with corresponding equivalent parameter types and corresponding <strong>var</strong> or non-<strong>var</strong> of the parameters and equivalent result types,</li>
<li> both pointer types to the same class or equivalent type and both are checked or unchecked.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each separate instance of a record, union or enumerated type (written out using one of the keywords <strong>record</strong>, <strong>union</strong> or <strong>enum</strong>) creates a distinct type, equivalent to no other type. By contrast, separate instances of arrays, strings, subranges and sets are considered equivalent if their parts are equal and equivalent.</p>

<p>Opaque type <em>T</em>, exported from a module, monitor or class <em>M</em> as <strong>opaque</strong>, is a special case of equivalence. Outside of <em>M</em> this type is written <em>M</em>.<em>T</em>, and is considered to be distinct from all other types. By contrast, if type <em>U</em> is exported non-<strong>opaque</strong>, the usual rules of equivalence apply. The parameter or result type of an exported procedure or function or an exported constant is considered to have type <em>M</em>.<em>T</em> outside of <em>M</em> if the item is declared using the type identifier <em>T</em>. Outside of <em>M</em>, the <strong>opaque</strong> type can be assigned, but not compared.</p>

<p>It is not required that subprogram types have the same names and parameter names to be equivalent. They also do not require the same factoring of parameters across their types, as in <em>i</em>, <em>j:</em> <strong>int</strong> instead of <em>i:</em> <strong>int</strong>, <em>j:</em> <strong>int</strong>.</p>
