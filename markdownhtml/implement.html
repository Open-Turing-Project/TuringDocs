<h1>implement</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>An <em>implementClause</em> is:</p>

<p><strong>implement</strong> <em>implementItem</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>An <strong>implement</strong> clause is used to specify that the module, monitor or class containing the clause is to be the implementation of another module, monitor or class. This implementation is a special kind of expansion. The <strong>module</strong>, <strong>monitor</strong> or <strong>class</strong> containing the clause gains access to (inherits) all the declarations inside the target item. See <strong>inherit</strong> clause for rules about expansions, which are also rules for implementations.</p>

<p>The <strong>implement</strong> clause can only be used in a <strong>unit</strong>. See <strong>unit</strong> for the definition of a unit.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Here is a <em>stack</em> module which defers all of its exported subprograms. This module is an interface but not an implementation. Following <em>stack</em> is the <em>stackBody</em> module that implements the <em>stack</em> module, giving the bodies for <em>stack</em>'s subprograms. Any call to <em>stack's</em> <em>push</em> or <em>pop</em> procedures, such as <em>stack</em>.<em>push(</em>"Ed"<em>)</em>, will actually call the procedures given in <em>stackBody</em>.</p>

<p>Next comes the expansion which gives the bodies for the deferred procedures <em>push</em> and <em>pop</em>. The <em>stackBody</em> body also adds declarations for the <em>top</em> and <em>contents</em> variables.</p>

<pre><code>    module stack                % Interface
        implement by stackBody
                            % stackBody has implementation
        export push, pop
        deferred procedure push ( s : string )
        deferred procedure pop ( var s : string )
    end stack        module stackBody        % Implementation
        implement stack     % stack has interface
        var top : int := 0
        var contents : array 1 .. 100 of string

        body procedure push % ( s : string )
            top := top + 1
            contents ( top ) := s
        end push

        body procedure pop      % ( var s : string )
            s := contents ( top )
            top := top - 1
        end pop
    end stackBody
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Module, monitor or class <em>D</em> can be in <em>C'</em>s implement-by clause if, and only if, <em>C</em> is in <em>D'</em>s implement clause. In other words, an interface must apply to exactly one implementation and vice versa. A module can implement only a module, a monitor only a monitor, and a class only a class. Classes (but not modules and monitors) can contain inherit clauses. A class cannot contain both an inherit and an implement clause.</p>

<p>An <em>implementItem</em> is one of<em>:</em></p>

<p>(a) <em>id</em>
(b) <em>id</em> <strong>in</strong> <em>fileName</em></p>

<p>The second form is used when the implement clause is for a separate <strong>unit</strong> and the imported item is in a file whose name is different from the item's name, as in:</p>

<p>The <em>fileName</em> must be an explicit character string, e.g., "ledg.t". See also <strong>unit</strong>. Parentheses are allowed around the items in <strong>implement</strong> clauses, as in:</p>

<p>There is no restriction on the declarations that an interface may contain. In particular, an interface (any module, monitor or class containing an implement-by clause), can contain subprogram bodies and variable declarations, exactly as is the case in expansions. This is different from languages such as C++ in which there are strict rules limiting what you can put in an interface.</p>

<p>Even though <em>D</em> contains an <strong>implement</strong> clause, <em>D</em> can also contain an implement-by clause, which implies further implementation by further automatic expansion.</p>

<p>Suppose class <em>D</em> is in class <em>C</em>'s implement-by clause and that <em>p</em> is a pointer to class <em>C</em>:</p>

<p>Even though <em>C</em> is implemented by <em>D</em>, <em>p</em> remains a pointer to class <em>C</em>. Each creation of an object of class <em>C</em> actually creates an object of type <em>D</em>, for example:</p>

<p>Class <em>D</em>, which implements <em>C</em>, could also have an implement-by clause, which causes its implementation to be automatically created and so on. If another class <em>E</em> inherits <em>C</em>, this expansion does not include <em>D</em>.</p>

<p>If the <strong>new</strong> statement contains an explicit class name <em>E</em> that is a descendant of <em>C</em> (but not actually C), as in</p>

<p>the object of the explicit class is created. If <em>E</em> has an implement-by clause, the expansion is created.</p>

<pre><code>    implement ledger in "ledg.t"        implement ( ledger in "ledg.t" )        var p : ^ C        new p   % Creates object of class D        new E, p
</code></pre>
