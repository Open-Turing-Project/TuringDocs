<h2>if</h2>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A conditional compilation <strong>#if</strong> has the form:</p>

<p><strong>#if</strong> <em>expn</em> <strong>then</strong>
<em>&#133; any source text &#133;</em>
{ <strong>#elsif</strong> <em>expn</em> <strong>then</strong>
<em>&#133; any source text &#133;</em> }
[ <strong>#else</strong>
<em>&#133; any source text &#133;</em> ]
<strong>#end</strong> <strong>if</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>An #<strong>if</strong> construct supports compile time selection of sections of source text to make up a program (or unit of a program), in other words <em>conditional compilation</em>. Any arbitrary source text (characters) can be selected.</p>

<p>Each of the selecting expressions (<em>expns</em>) have the form of a boolean expression, with the use of the operators <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong> and <strong>not</strong> (but not =>) and parentheses. The short forms &amp; and ~ are supported. The operands of the expressions must be <em>preprocessor flags</em>, which are set by a system- dependent mechanism not described here. A flag is considered to be <strong>true</strong> if it is explicitly set. If it is not explicitly set, it is considered false.</p>

<p>Unlike other parts of the language, the <strong>#if</strong>, <strong>#elsif</strong>, <strong>#else</strong> and <strong>#end</strong> <strong>if</strong> constructs are not free format. Specifically, they must be placed by themselves on a single line.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>A pair of declarations is chosen if both <em>stats</em> and <em>debug</em> are set, otherwise the <strong>put</strong> statement is selected. The selected part becomes part of the program and the other parts are ignored.</p>

<pre><code>    #if stats and debug then
        var count : array 1 .. 5 of real
        var message : string
    #else
        put "Debugging message"
    #end if
</code></pre>
