<h1>pre</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>An <em>preAssertion </em>is:</p>

<p><strong>pre</strong> <em>trueFalseExpn</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A <strong>pre</strong> assertion is a special form of an <strong>assert</strong> statement that is used at the beginning of a procedure or function. It is used to give requirements that the caller of the procedure or functions is supposed to satisfy. These requirements are given by the <em>trueFalseExpn</em>. The <em>trueFalseExpn </em>is evaluated. If it is true, all is well and execution continues. If it is false, execution is terminated with an appropriate message. See <strong>assert</strong> statements and <strong>procedure</strong> and <strong>function</strong> declarations for more details. See also <strong>post</strong> and <strong>invariant</strong> assertions.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This function computes the average of <em>n values</em>. Its <strong>pre</strong> condition requires that <em>n</em> must be strictly positive, to avoid the possibility of dividing by zero when computing the average.</p>

<pre><code>    function average ( a : array 1 .. * of real, n : int) : real
        pre n &gt; 0
        var sum : real := 0
        for i : 1 .. n
            sum := sum + a ( i )
        end for
        result sum / n
    end average
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A <strong>pre</strong> assertion can also be used in a <strong>module</strong>, <strong>monitor</strong>, <strong>class</strong> or <strong>process</strong> declaration to make sure that requirements for initialization are met.</p>
