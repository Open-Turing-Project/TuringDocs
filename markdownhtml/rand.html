<h1>rand</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>rand</strong> (<strong>var</strong> <em>r</em> : <strong>real</strong>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>rand</strong> statement is used to create a pseudo-random number in the range zero to one. For example, if <em>x</em> is a real number, after <strong>rand</strong>(<em>x</em>), <em>x</em> would have a value such as 0.729548 or 0.352879.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program repeatedly and randomly prints out <em>Hi ho</em>, <em>hi ho</em> or <em>It's off to work we go</em>.</p>

<pre><code>    var r : real
    loop
        rand ( r )
        if r &gt; 0.5 then
            put "Hi ho, hi ho"
        else
            put "It's off to work we go"
        end if
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The <strong>rand</strong> statement sets its parameter to the next value of a sequence of pseudo-random real numbers that approximates a uniform distribution over the range 0&lt;<em>r</em> &lt;1.
Each time a program runs, <strong>rand</strong> uses a different pseudo-random number sequence. To get the same sequence (use <strong>Rand.Set</strong>).
To use several sequences of repeatable pseudo-random number sequences, use the <strong>randseed</strong> and <strong>randnext</strong> procedures.
In many languages, <strong>rand</strong> would be a function rather than a procedure. It has been designed as a procedure in Turing to respect the mathematical idea that every call to a function using the same arguments (or no arguments at all) should return the same value. If <strong>rand</strong> were a function, this would not be true.</p>
