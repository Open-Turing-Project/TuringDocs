<h1>Joystick</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This unit contains the predefined subprogram that deal with reading the joystick in a Turing program. The routines allow you to get the current joystick position and whether either one of the two buttons are pressed.
All routines in the Joystick module are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<strong>Joystick.</strong>"). All the constants are exported unqualified and thus do not need the <strong>Joystick</strong> prefix.</p>
