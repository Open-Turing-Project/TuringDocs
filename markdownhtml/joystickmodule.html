<h1>Joystick</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This unit contains the predefined subprogram that deal with reading the joystick in a Turing program. The routines allow you to get the current joystick position and whether either one of the two buttons are pressed.</p>

<p>All routines in the Joystick module are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<strong>Joystick.</strong>"). All the constants are exported unqualified and thus do not need the <strong>Joystick</strong> prefix.</p>
