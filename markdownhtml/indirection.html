<h1>indirection</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><em>targetType</em> <strong>@</strong> ( <em>expn</em> )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The indirection operator @ is used to access values that lie at absolute machine addresses in the computer's memory. This is dangerous and implementation-dependent and can cause arbitrary corruption of data and programs.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Copy the byte value at memory location 246 into <em>b</em> and then set that memory byte to zero.</p>

<pre><code>    var b : nat1            % One byte natural number
    b := nat1 @ (246)
    nat1 @ (246) := 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The form of <em>targetType</em> must be one of:
In form (a) the beginning identifier <em>id</em> must be the name of a module, monitor or class that exports the <em>typeId</em>. Each of <em>numberOfCharacters</em> and <em>maximumLength</em> must be compile time integer expressions. These are the same target types as in type cheats.
The indirection operator @ takes an integer as an address. This value must fit in the range of <strong>addressint</strong>. See <strong>addressint</strong>. See also <strong>pointer</strong> types and the ^ operator (which accesses objects located by pointers).</p>

<pre><code>    (a) [ id . ] typeId
    (b) int, int1, int2 or int4
    (c) nat, nat1, nat2 or nat4
    (d) boolean
    (e) char [ ( numberOfCharacters ) ]
    (f) string [ ( maximumLength ) ]
    (g) addressint
</code></pre>
