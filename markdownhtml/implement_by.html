<h1>implement by</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>An <em>implementByClause</em> is:   <strong>implement</strong> <strong>by</strong> <em>implementByItem</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>An implement-by clause is used to specify that a module, monitor or class <em>C</em> is to be automatically implemented by the <em>implementByItem</em>. <em>C</em> is called the <em>interface</em> and the <em>implementByItem</em>, which must contain an implement clause, is called the <em>implementation</em>. See <strong>implement</strong> clause for details and an example.</p>

<p>The implement-by clause can only be used in a <strong>unit</strong>. See <strong>unit</strong> for the definition of a unit.</p>

<p>An implementByItem is one of:</p>

<p>(a)   <em>id</em>
(b)   <em>id</em> <strong>in</strong> <em>fileName</em></p>

<p>The second form is used when the implement-by clause is for a separate <strong>unit</strong> and the imported item is in a file whose name is different from the item's name, as in:</p>

<p>The fileName must be an explicit character string, e.g., "ledgbod.t". See also <strong>unit</strong>. Parentheses are allowed around the items in an <strong>implement-by</strong> clauses, as in:</p>

<pre><code>    implement by ledgerBody in "ledgbod.t"        implement by ( ledgerBody in "ledgbod.t" )
</code></pre>
