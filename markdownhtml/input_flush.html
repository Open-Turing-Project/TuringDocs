<h1>Input.Flush</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Input.Flush</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>Input.Flush</strong> procedure empties the keyboard buffer. It is often used to avoid accidentally reading multiplekeystrokes because the user pressed a key for too long, causing autorepeat.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program echoes input from the keyboard at a rate of 10 characters per second. If you hold down a key, the echoing will stop as soon as you stoppressing the key. Without the <strong>Input.Flush</strong>, the program continues to echo many more keystrokes that have accumulated in the keyboard buffer.</p>

<pre><code>    loop
        if hasch then
            put getchar ..
            Input.Flush
            delay (100)
        end if
    end loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Input.Flush</strong>, not by calling <strong>Flush</strong>.</p>
