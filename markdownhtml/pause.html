<h1>pause</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>pauseStatement</em> is:
<strong>pause</strong> <em>expn</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>pause</strong> statement blocks the program (or just the process in the case of a concurrent program) for a given number of simulated time units. The <em>expn</em> must be a non-negative <strong>int</strong> value giving the number of time units. This is analogous to the <strong>delay</strong> statement, which causes blocking for a given amount of real time (actual physical time).
The interpreter maintains a counter which it considers to be simulated time. The only execution that causes this counter to increase is the <strong>pause</strong> statement. The process executing the <strong>pause</strong> is blocked until the counter has counted forward the number of units given by <em>expn</em>. All other statements (except <strong>wait</strong>) are considered to be infinitely fast. Several processes can be executing <strong>pause</strong> statements simultaneously.
The use of simulated time allows Turing to be used as a simulation language in which the <strong>pause</strong> statement simulates the passage of time in the simulated system.</p>
