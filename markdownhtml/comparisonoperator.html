<h1>comparisonOperator</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>comparisonOperator</em> is one of:   (a) <strong>&lt;</strong>   <em>% Less than</em>   (b) <strong>></strong>   <em>% Greater than</em>   (c) =   <em>% Equal</em>   (d) <strong>&lt;</strong>=   <em>% Less than or equal; subset</em>   (e) <strong>></strong>=   <em>% Greater than or equal; superset</em>   (f) <strong>not=</strong>   <em>% Not equal</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A comparison operator is placed between two values to determine their equality or ordering. For example, 7 > 2 is true and so is "Adam" &lt; "Cathy". The comparison operators can be applied to numbers as well as to enumerated types. They can also be applied to strings to determine the <em>ordering</em> between strings (see the <strong>string</strong> type for details). Arrays, records, unions and collections cannot be compared. Boolean values (<strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>) can be compared only for equality (= and <strong>not=</strong>); the same is true of  <strong>pointer</strong> values. Set values can be compared using &lt;= and >=, which are the subset and superset operators. The <strong>not=</strong> operator can be written as ~=.</p>

<p>Comparisons among classes is also supported (see <strong>class</strong>). If <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> are classes, <em>C</em> &lt;= <em>D</em> means <em>D</em> is a descendant of (inherits from) <em>C</em>. See <strong>class</strong>.</p>
