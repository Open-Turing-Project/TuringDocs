<h1>Music.Play</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Music.Play</strong> ( <em>music</em> : <strong>string</strong> )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>Music.Play</strong> procedure is used to sound musical notes on the computer.
Sounds are produced synchronously on a per process basis. This means that when a process executes a <strong>Music.Sound</strong> or <strong>Music.Play</strong> command, it stops until the command is finished. However, other processes will continue to executing.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program sounds the first three notes of the C scale.</p>

<pre><code>    Music.Play ( "cde" )
</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program plays from middle C to one octave above middle C and down again in 8th notes.</p>

<pre><code>    Music.Play ( "8cdefgab&gt;c" )
    Music.Play ( "&lt;bagfedc" )
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The syntax of the play string may be enhanced in the future.
The <strong>Music.Play</strong> procedure takes strings containing characters that specify notes, rests, sharps, flats and duration. The notes are the letters a to g (or A to G). A rest is p (for pause). A sharp is <strong>+</strong> and a flat is <strong>-</strong>. The durations are 1 (whole note), 2 (half note), 4 (quarter note), 8 (eight note) and 6 (sixteenth note). The character > raises to the next octave and &lt; lowers. For example, this is the way to play C and then C sharp one octave above middle C with a rest between them, all in sixteenth notes:  <strong>Music.Play</strong>(">6cpc+"). Blanks can be used for readability and are ignored by <strong>Music.Play</strong>.
The <strong>Music.Play</strong> procedure requires that the machine have a sound card in order to play tones.</p>
