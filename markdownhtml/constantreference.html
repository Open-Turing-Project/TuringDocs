<h1>constantReference</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>constantReference</em> is:
<em>constantId</em> { <em>componentSelector</em> }</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In a Turing program, a constant is declared and given a name (<em>constantId</em>) and then used. Each use is called a <em>constant reference</em>.
If the constant is an array, record or union, its parts (<em>components</em>) can be selected using subscripts and field names (using <em>componentSelectors</em>). The form of a <em>componentSelector </em>is one of:
(a)(<em>expn</em> {, <em>expn</em>} )(b). <em>fieldId</em>
Form (a) is used for subscripting (indexing) arrays. The number of array subscripts must be the same as in the array's declaration. Form (b) is used for selecting a field of a <strong>record</strong> or <strong>union</strong>. Component selectors are used in the same manner as variable references. See <em>variableReference</em> for details. See also <strong>const</strong> declaration and <em>explicitConstant</em>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    var radius : real
    const pi := 3.14159     % Constant declaration
    &#133;
    put "Area is: ", pi * radius **2
                        % pi is a constant reference.
</code></pre>
