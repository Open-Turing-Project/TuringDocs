<h1>Music.Sound</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Music.Sound</strong> ( <em>frequency</em>, <em>duration</em> : <strong>int</strong> )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>Music.Sound</strong> statement is used to cause the computer to sound a note of a given frequency for a given time. The frequency is in cycles per second (Hertz). The time duration is in milliseconds. For example, middle A on a piano is 440 Hertz, so <strong>Music.Sound</strong>(440, 1000) plays middle A for one second.</p>

<p>Sounds are produced synchronously on a per process basis. This means that when a process executes a <strong>Music.Sound</strong> or <strong>Music.Play</strong> command, it stops until the command is finished. However, other processes will continue executing.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program plays a siren sound in the background.</p>

<pre><code>    process siren
        loop
            for i : 100 .. 3000 by 100
                Music.Sound ( i, 50 )   % Sound note
            end for
            for decreasing i : 2900 .. 200 by 100
                Music.Sound ( i, 50 )   % Sound note
            end for
        end loop
    end siren

    fork siren
    &#133; the rest of the program goes here while the siren continues &#133;
</code></pre>
