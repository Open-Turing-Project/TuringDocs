<h1>Pic.Mirror</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Pic.Mirror</strong> (<em>picID</em> : <strong>int</strong>) : <strong>int</strong></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><strong>Pic.Mirror</strong> is used to create a new picture by flipping the picture horizontally. The resulting picture is exactly the same size as the original, except it appears as a &#147;mirror image&#148;.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Note that the mirror-imaged picture is a newly created picture. When it is no longer needed, its memory should be released by using <strong>Pic.Free</strong>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The program draws a crescent on the screen, takes a picture of it and then creates a second picture by mirror-imaging the crescent. It then draws both the original picture and the mirror-imaged version.</p>

<p><strong>Output from the Program</strong></p>

<pre><code>    View.Set ("graphics:210;125,nobuttonbar")

    % Get the original picture
    var pic, newPic : int
    Draw.FillOval (50, 50, 50, 50, brightred)
    Draw.FillOval (70, 50, 50, 50, colorbg)
    Draw.Text ("BLUE", 40, 60, defFontID, brightblue)
    Draw.Text ("MOON", 40, 40, defFontID, brightblue)
    pic := Pic.New (0, 0, 100, 100)
    newPic := Pic. Mirror (pic)
    cls

    % Draw the two images: original and flipped
    Pic.Draw (pic, 10, 20, picCopy)
    Draw.Text ("Original", 10, 5, defFontID, black) 
    Pic.Draw (newPic, 110, 20, picCopy)
    Draw.Text ("Flipped", 140, 5, defFontID, black) 
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>
