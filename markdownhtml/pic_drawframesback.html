<h1>Pic.DrawFramesBack</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Pic.DrawFramesBack</strong> (<em>picIds</em> : <strong>array</strong> 1 .. * <strong>of int</strong>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>mode</em> : <strong>int</strong>,       <em>numFrames</em>, <em>delayBetweenFrames</em> : <strong>int</strong>, <em>eraseAfter</em> : <strong>boolean</strong>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><strong>Pic.DrawFramesBack</strong> is very similar to <strong><a href="pic_drawframes.html">Pic.DrawFrames</a></strong>.  The onlydifference is that <strong>Pic.DrawFramesBack</strong> returns immediatelyafter being called and program execution continues while the framesare being drawn.  This allows you to continue to draw other graphicswhile the frames are being drawn.</p>

<p>For example, this procedure is necessary if you want to have two sets of frames being drawn simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>If you are wish to have several sets of images displayed at the same time, you must use <strong>Pic.DrawFramesBack</strong> to display each setof images but the last and then use <strong>Pic.DrawFrames</strong> to displaythe last set so that Turing will wait until they are completed before continuing execution.</p>

<p>If you want to draw the same set of frames continuously, do not use<strong>Pic.DrawFramesBack</strong>.</p>

<p><code>**for** _i_ : 1 .. 20    **Pic.DrawFrames** (_pics_, 10, 10, _picCopy_, 10, 50, **false**)    % Do not use Pic.DrawFramesBack in the previous statement**end for**</code></p>

<p>If you do, Turing will attempt to run each of the calls at the sametime, and the animation will appear to only run once.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>GIF files can contain multiple frames (pictures).  Animated GIFs function by each frame in the GIF one after another with a delaybetween them.</p>

<p>Turing allows users to load multiple frame GIF images into a seriesof pictures into an array using the <strong><a href="pic_filenewframes.html">Pic.FileNewFrames</a></strong> procedure.  The user can determine how many frames are found in the GIF file using <strong><a href="pic_frames.html">Pic.Frames</a></strong>.  The frames can be sequentially displayed using either <strong><a href="pic_drawframes.html">Pic.DrawFrames</a></strong> or <strong><a href="">Pic.DrawFramesBack</a></strong> which display the images one at a time.(<strong><a href="pic_drawframes.html">Pic.DrawFrames</a></strong> returns once all the images have been displayed, <strong><a href="">Pic.DrawFramesBack</a></strong> returns immediately allowing the program to continue execution while the frames are being displayed.</p>

<p><strong><a href="pic_frames.html">Pic.Frames</a></strong> is a function which returns the number of frames found in the GIF.  If it is used on a GIF that does not contain multiple images, or on a non-GIF image file, it returns 1.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The program loads a multiple frame GIF called "globe.gif" and displays it.</p>

<pre><code>    % Determine the number of frames in "globe.gif"
    var numFrames := Pic.Frames ("globe.gif")
    % Load the picture
    var delayTime : int
    var pics : array 1 .. numFrames of int

Pic.FileNewFrames ("globe.gif", pics, delayTime)
for i : 1 .. 50
    Pic.DrawFramesBack (pics, 10, 10, picMerge, numFrames, 50, false)
    Pic.DrawFramesBack (pics, 20 + Pic.Width (pics(1)), 10, picMerge, numFrames, 50, false)
    % All 50 iterations will execute at once if the next call is 
    % Pic.DrawFramesBack, and not Pic.DrawFrames
    Pic.DrawFrames (pics, 30 + 2 * Pic.Width (pics(1)), 10, picMerge, numFrames, 50, false)
end for
for i : 1 .. numFramesPic.Free (pics (i))
end for
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Pic.DrawFrames</strong>, not by calling <strong>DrawFrames</strong>.</p>
