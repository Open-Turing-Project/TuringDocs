<h1>locatexy</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>locatexy</strong> ( <em>x</em> , <em>y</em> : <strong>int</strong> )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>locatexy</strong> procedure is used to move the cursor so that the next output from <strong>put</strong> will be at approximately (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>). The exact location may be somewhat to the left of <em>x</em> and below <em>y</em> to force alignment to a character boundary.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program outputs "Hello" starting at approximately (100, 50) on the screen.</p>

<pre><code>    setscreen ("graphics")
    locatexy ( 100, 50 )
    put "Hello"
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The <strong>locatexy</strong> procedure is used to locate the next output based on x and y positions, where the position x=0, y=0 is the left bottom of the screen. See also the <strong>locate</strong> procedure which is used to locate the output-based row and column positions, where row 1 is the top row and column 1 is the left column.</p>

<p>The screen should be in a "<em>graphics</em>" mode. See the <strong>setscreen</strong> procedure for details. If the screen is not in a "<em>graphics</em>" mode, it will automatically be set to "<em>graphics</em>" mode.</p>
