<h1>Input.getch</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>getch</strong> ( <strong>var</strong> <em>ch</em> : <strong>string</strong> ( 1 ) )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>getch</strong> procedure is used to input a single character without waiting for the end of a line. The parameter <em>ch</em> is set to the next character in the keyboard buffer (the oldest not-yet-read character).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program contains a procedure called <em>getKey</em> which causes the program to wait until a key is pressed.</p>

<pre><code>    View.Set ("graphics")

    procedure getKey
        var ch : string (1)
        getch (ch)
    end getKey

    for i : 1 .. 1000
        put i : 4, " Pause till a key is pressed"
        getKey
    end for
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The screen should be in a "<em>screen</em>" or "<em>graphics</em>" mode. See the <strong>View.Set</strong> procedure for details. If the screen is not in one of these modes, it will automatically be set to "<em>screen</em>" mode.</p>

<p>Some keys, such as the left arrow key, insert key, delete key, and function keys do not produce ordinary character values. These keystrokes are returned by <strong>getch</strong> as special values. See Appendix D for these values.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported unqualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can call the function by calling <strong>getch</strong> or by calling <strong>Input.getch</strong>.</p>
