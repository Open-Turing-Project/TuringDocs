<h1>Dir.Delete</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>Dir.Delete</strong> (<em>directoryPathName</em> : <strong>string</strong>)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><strong>Dir.Delete</strong> is used to delete the directory specified by the parameter <em>directoryPathName</em>. This is the equivalent of doing a <strong>rmdir</strong> in DOS or UNIX. On the Macintosh, it removes a folder.</p>

<p><strong>Dir.Delete</strong> will fail if it attempts delete a directory that has files in it.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>If the <strong>Dir.Delete</strong> call fails, then <strong>Error.Last</strong> will return a non-zero value indicating the reason for the failure. <strong>Error.LastMsg</strong> will return a string which contains the textual version of the error.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program deletes the directory called <em>information</em>.</p>

<pre><code>    Dir.Delete ("information")
    if Error.Last = eNoError then
        put "Directory delete"
    else
        put "Did not delete the directory."
        put "Error: ", Error.LastMsg
    end if
</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>An example demonstrating the use of several of the <strong>Dir</strong> subprogramsis available. In this example, a directory is created, a file is writtento the directory, an attempt is made to delete the directory, the file isdeleted, and then the directory is deleted.</p>

<p>This example demonstrates the use of <strong>Dir.Change</strong>, <strong>Dir.Current</strong>, <strong>Dir.Create</strong>, and <strong>Dir.Delete</strong>.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Dir.Delete</strong>, not by calling <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
