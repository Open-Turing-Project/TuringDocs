<p>The <strong>Net</strong> module requires a TCP/IP stack to be installed and operating in order to function. It does not communicate using any other protocols</p>

<p>It is possible for Firewalls to interfere with the actions of the <strong>Net</strong> module, preventing connections from taking place.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following program prints out the TCP/IP numeric address of the current machine.</p>

<pre><code>    put "Your machine address is ", Net.LocalAddress
</code></pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Exported qualified.</p>

<p>This means that you can only call the function by calling <strong>Net.LocalAddress</strong>, not by calling <strong>LocalAddress</strong>.</p>
