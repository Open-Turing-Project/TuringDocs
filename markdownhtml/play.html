<h1>play</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><strong>play</strong> ( <em>music</em> : <strong>string</strong> )</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>play</strong> procedure is used to sound musical notes on the computer.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program sounds the first three notes of the C scale.</p>

<pre><code>    play ( "cde" )
</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This program plays from middle C to one octave above middle C and down again in 8th notes.</p>

<pre><code>    play ( "8cdefgab&gt;c" )
    play ( "&lt;bagfedc" )
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The <strong>play</strong> procedure takes strings containing characters that specify notes, rests, sharps, flats and  duration. The notes are the letters a to g (or A to G). A rest is p (for pause). A sharp is <strong>+</strong> and a flat is <strong>-</strong>. The durations are 1 (whole note), 2 (half note), 4 (quarter note), 8 (eight note) and 6 (sixteenth note). The character > raises to the next octave and &lt; lowers. For example, this is the way to play C and then C sharp one octave above middle C with a rest between them, all in sixteenth notes:  <strong>play</strong>(">6cpc+"). Blanks can be used for readability and are ignored by <strong>play</strong>.</p>

<p>Under some systems such as UNIX, the <strong>play</strong> procedure may have no effect.</p>

<p>The current (1999) implementation does not support play.</p>
