<h1>prefix</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>prefixOperator</em>  is one of:</p>

<p>(a)<strong>+</strong> <em>% Integer and real identity</em>
<em>% (does not change value)</em>
(b) <em>% Integer and real negation</em>
(c)<strong>not</strong> <em>% Not (Boolean negation)</em>
(d)<strong>#</strong> <em>% Type cheat</em>
(e)**<sup>**</sup> <em>% Pointer following</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A <em>prefix operator</em> is placed before a value or <em>operand </em>to produce another value. For example, if the value of <em>x </em>is seven, then -<em>x </em>is negative seven. There are also infix operators such as multiplication (*) and addition (+), which are placed between two values to produce a third value. See <em>infix operator</em>.
The + and  prefix operators can be applied only to numeric values (integer, real and natural numbers). The <strong>not</strong> prefix can be applied only to true/false (boolean) values. For example <strong>not</strong> (<em>x </em>> <em>y</em>)<em> _ is equivalent to </em>x <em>&lt;= </em>y_. The <strong>not</strong> operator produces <strong>true</strong> from <strong>false</strong> and <strong>false</strong> from <strong>true</strong>.
The # operators is a type cheat (see <strong>cheat</strong>), and the ^ operator is pointer following (see <strong>pointer</strong>).</p>

<p>See also <strong>int</strong>, <strong>real</strong> and <strong>boolean</strong> types, as well as <em>precedence </em>(for the order of applying operators) and <em>infix operators</em>.</p>
