<h1>variableReference</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>variableReference</em> is:</p>

<p><em>variableId</em> { <em>componentSelector</em> }</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In a Turing program, a variable is declared and given a name (<em>variableId</em>) and then used. Each use is called a <em>variable reference</em>.
If the variable is an array, collection, record or union, its parts (<em>components</em>) can be selected using subscripts and field names (using <em>componentSelectors</em>). The form of a <em>componentSelector </em>is one of:\</p>

<p>Form (a) is used for subscripting (indexing) arrays and collections. The number of array subscripts must be the same as in the array's declaration. A collection has exactly one subscript, which must be a pointer to the collection. Form (b) is used for selecting a field of a record or union.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Following the declarations of <em>k</em>,<em> a </em>and <em>r</em>, each of <em>k</em>,<em> a </em>(<em>k</em>) and <em>r</em>.<em>name </em>are variable references.</p>

<pre><code>    var k : int
    var a : array 1 .. 100 of real
    var r :
        record
            name : string ( 20 )
            phone : string ( 8 )
        end record
    &#133;
    k := 5
    a ( k ) := 3.14159
    r . name := "Steve Cook"
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A variable reference can contain more than one component selector, for example, when the variable is an array of records. For an example, see the <strong>record</strong> type. See also <em>constantReference</em> and <strong>var</strong> declaration.</p>
