<h1>procedure</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>A <em>procedureDeclaration</em> is:</p>

<p><strong>procedure</strong> <em>id</em> [(<em>paramDeclaration</em> {, <em>paramDeclaration</em> })]
<em>statementsAndDeclarations</em>
<strong>end</strong> <em>id</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A procedure declaration creates (but does not run) a new procedure. The name of the procedure (<em>id</em>) is given in two places, just after <strong>procedure</strong> and just after <strong>end</strong>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>    procedure greetings
        put "Hello world"
    end greetings

    greetings           % This outputs Hello world

    procedure sayItAgain ( msg : string, n : int )
        for i : 1 .. n
            put msg
        end for
    end sayItAgain

    sayItAgain ("Toot", 2 ) % Toot is output twice

    procedure double ( var x : real )
        x := 2 * x
    end double

    var y : real := 3.14
    double ( y )        % This doubles the value of y
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The set of parameters declared with the procedure are called <em>formal</em> parameters. In the <em>double</em> procedure, for example, <em>x</em> is a formal parameter. A procedure is called (invoked) by a procedure <em>call statement</em> which consists of the procedure's name followed by the parenthesized list of <em>actual</em> parameters (if any). For example, <em>double</em>(<em>y</em>) is a call having <em>y</em> as an actual parameter. If there are no parameters (see the <em>greet</em> procedure above), the call does not have parentheses. The keyword <strong>procedure</strong> can be abbreviated to <strong>proc</strong>.
Ordinarily, a procedure <em>returns</em> (finishes and goes back to the place where it was called) by reaching its <strong>end</strong>. However, the <strong>return</strong> statement in a procedure causes it to return immediately. Note that <strong>return</strong> can also be used in the main program to cause it to halt immediately.
Only parameters declared using <strong>var</strong> may be changed in the procedure, for example, <em>x</em> is changed in the <em>double</em> procedure. The upper bounds of arrays and strings that are parameters may be declared to be an asterisk (<strong>*</strong>). This means that the bound is that of the actual parameter. See <em>paramDeclaration</em> for details about parameters.
Procedures and functions cannot be declared inside other procedures and functions.
The syntax of a <em>procedureDeclaration</em> presented above has been simplified by leaving out the optional <strong>import</strong> list, <strong>pre</strong> condition, <strong>init</strong> clause, <strong>post</strong> condition and exception handler. The full syntax is
A procedure must be declared before being called. To allow for mutually recursive procedures, there are <strong>forward</strong> declarations of procedures with later declaration of each procedure <strong>body</strong>. See <strong>forward</strong> and <strong>body</strong> declarations for explanations.</p>

<pre><code>    procedure [ pervasive ] id
        [ ( [ paramDeclaration {,paramDeclaration } ] ) ]
        [ : deviceSpecification ]
        [ pre trueFalseExpn ]
        [ init id := expn {, id := expn } ]
        [ post trueFalseExpn ]
        [ exceptionHandler ]
        statementsAndDeclarations
    end id
</code></pre>
