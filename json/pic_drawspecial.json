      "mdown_content": "**Pic.DrawSpecial** is used to draw a picture on the screen with aspecial effect such as a wipe, a slide, or a fade-in. The picture is drawn with the lower left corner at (_x_, _y_). The _duration_ specifies how long thetransition should take in milliseconds.  For example, a fade-in couldbe specified to last 1/2 a second by using a duration of 500.\n\nThe _mode_ parameter is the same as in **Pic.New** and has one of the following values:\n\n\n_picCopy_   This draws the picture on top of what was underneath, obscuring it completely.\n_picXor_   This draws the picture XORing it with the background. In DOS, you can use this function to do animation. Drawing an object on top of itself with XOR erases it and restores the background.\n_picMerge_   This draws the picture like _picCopy_ except that any occurrence of the background color in the picture is not drawn to the screen. This allows you to draw an irregularly-shaped object and draw it to the screen.\n_picUnderMerge_   This draws the picture, but only where the background color was displayed underneath it. The effect of this is to make the picture appear to be displayed behind the background.\n\n\nThe _transition_ parameter indicates the special effect and hasone of the following values:\n\n\n_picWipeLeftToRight_ The picture appears as a solid black bar sweeps from left toright, \"revealing\" the new picture as the screen underneaththe picture is replaced.\n\nIn the picture below, \"to Turing\" is replacing the \"Welcome\"underneath as the bar sweeps from left to right.\n\n![Doc Image](pic_drawspecial01.gif)\n\n**picWipeLeftToRight - half way through transition**\n\n\n_picWipeRightToLeft_, _picWipeTopToBottom_, _picWipeBottomToTop_ As _picWipeLeftToRight_, except the bar sweeps in different directions.\n_picWipeUpperLeftToLowerRight_ The picture appears as a solid black bar sweeps from the upperleft corner down to the lower right, \"revealing\" the new picture as the screen underneath the picture is replaced.\n\nIn the picture below \"to Turing\" is replacing the \"Welcome\"underneath as the bar sweeps from upper-left to lower-right.\n\n![Doc Image](pic_drawspecial05.gif)\n\n**picWipeUpperLeftToLowerRight - half way through transition**\n\n\n_picWipeUpperRightToLowerLeft_, _picWipeLowerLeftToUpperRight_, _picWipeLowerRightToUpperLeft_ As _picWipeLeftToRight_, except the bar sweeps in different directions.\n_picWipeCentreToEdge_, _picWipeCenterToEdge_ The picture appears inside an expanding black outlined box as it sweeps from the centre out to the edges, \"revealing\" the new picture as the screen underneath the picture is replaced.\n\nIn the picture below, \"to Turing\" is replacing the \"Welcome\"underneath as the box expands from the centre out.\n\n![Doc Image](pic_drawspecial06.gif)\n\n**picWipeCentreToEdge - half way through transition**\n\n\n_picWipeLeftToRightNoBar_, _picWipeRightToLeftNoBar_, _picWipeTopToBottomNoBar_, _picWipeBottomToTopNoBar__picWipeUpperLeftToLowerRightNoBar_, _picWipeUpperRightToLowerLeftNoBar_, _picWipeLowerLeftToUpperRightNoBar_, _picWipeLowerRightToUpperLeftNoBar_,_picWipeCentreToEdgeNoBar_, _picWipeCenterToEdgeNoBar_ As the constants above, expect there is no bar to mark thesweep across.
