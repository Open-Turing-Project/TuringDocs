	<h1>Pic.Scale</h1>
	
		
		

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Pic.Scale</b> (<i>picID</i>, <i>newWidth</i>, <i>newHeight</i> : <b>int</b>) : <b>int</b><p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<b>Pic.Scale </b>is used to create a new picture by scaling (resizing) 
	  an already existing picture. Rotation can either be around a specific 
	  point in the picture (often used for rotating a picure in place) or 
	  just a general rotation.<p>
	  The <i>newWidth</i> and <i>newHeight</i> parameters are the desired 
	  width and height of the new picture. The <i>newWidth</i> and 
	  <i>newHeight</i> parameters may be negative, in which case 
	  the picture is mirror image (<i>newWidth</i> is negative) or 
	  upside-down (<i>newHeight</i> is negative) and the absolute 
	  values are used for the new width and height values.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The <b>Pic.Scale</b> command can fail, in which case it 
          returns 0. The <b>Error.LastMsg</b> function can then be 
	  used to obtain more information about the failure.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Creating a larger picture by scaling a smaller picture 
          will result in a "grainy" image with each pixel being 
	  scaled up into 2 or 3 pixels. In general image quality 
	  is better if a large picture is scaled down. However, 
	  when a large picture is scaled down, thin one-pixel wide 
	  lines can "disappear".<p>
	  In order to scale a picture while retaining its original 
	  aspect ratio, scale with multiples of the original width 
	  and height. The width and height of a picture can be obtained 
	  using <b>Pic.Width</b> and <b>Pic.Height</b>.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Scaling can be slow on older machines. Programs that are using 
          animation should create and store all the scaled images that may 
	  be needed. Often pictures of an object at various sizes are stored 
	  in an array. <p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Note that the scaled picture is a newly created picture. When it is 
          no longer needed, its memory should be released by using 
	  <b>Pic.Free</b>.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program draws a set of stars scaled at 50%, 100% and 150% on 
          different axes. Note how some single-pixel lines are removed when 
	  the picture is scaled down..<p>

                Pic.Free (newPic)
                Draw.Text (realstr (x / 2, 0) + " x " + realstr (y / 2, 0),
                            (x - 1) * maxx div 3 + 5, (y - 1) * maxy div 3 + 5, 
                    defFontID, black)

        end for

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
	  This means that you can only call the function by calling 
	  <b>Pic.Scale</b>, not by calling <b>Scale</b>.</p>
