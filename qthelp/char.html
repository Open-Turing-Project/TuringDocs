			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>char</b><p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			Each variable whose type is a <b>char</b> contains a single character, such as the letter <i>A</i>, the digit <i>3</i> or the special character &amp;.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			Count characters until a period is found. Character <i>c</i> is read using a <b>get</b> statement and is compared to the explicit character constant '.'.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var c : char
        var counter := 0
        loop
            exit when eof
            get c           % Read a single character
            exit when c = '.'   % Single quotes for char constant
            counter := counter + 1
        end loop
        put counter, " characters before the period"</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			Count capital letters. This example illustrates the use of the <b>char</b> type as the subscript type for the <i>frequency</i> array, the use of character variable <i>c</i> as a subscript, and the use of <i>d</i> as a <b>for</b> counter that ranges across the letters A to Z.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var frequency : array 'A' .. 'Z' of nat
        for d : 'A' .. 'Z'
            frequency (d) := 0
        end for
        loop                % Tabulate use of capital letters
            exit when eof
            var c : char
            get c           % Read one character
            if c >= 'A' and c <= 'Z' then
                frequency (c) := frequency (c) + 1
            end if
        end loop
        for d : 'A' .. 'Z'      % Print frequency of capital letters
            put d, " ", frequency (d)
        end for</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The type <b>string</b> (or <b>char</b>(<i>n</i>)) is used instead of <b>char</b> when more than one character needs to be stored, such as the string of characters <i>Henry</i>. Unless the program needs to be quite efficient, it is usually easier to use the <b>string</b> type. See also the <b>char</b>(<i>n</i>) type, which always stores exactly<i> n </i>characters.<p>
The <b>char</b> type differs from the <b>string</b>(1) type in the following way: <b>char</b> always represents exactly one character, while <b>string</b>(1) can represent either the null string or a string containing one character. The <b>char</b> type is similar to the <b>char</b>(1) type in that both contain at most one character.</p>
<p>
The <b>char</b> type is an index type and can be used, for example, as subscripts, <b>for</b> ranges and <b>case</b> labels. For example, this declaration</p>
<p>
</p>
<table><tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td>
<b>var</b> <i>charCounts</i> : a<b>rray</b> <b>char</b> <b>of</b> <b>int</b>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
creates an array whose subscripts are characters.</p>
<p>
The <b>char</b> type is a scalar type, which implies that its parameters are passed by value, instead of by reference (which is the case for <b>char</b>(<i>n</i>) and <b>string</b>).</p>
<p>
Values of the <b>char</b> type can be assigned and they can be compared for both equality and ordering. Explicit <b>char</b> constants are written as a character surrounded by single quotes, for example, 'A'. For details, including how to write control characters, see <i>explicitCharConstant</i>.</p>
<p>
Characters can be read and written by <b>get</b> and <b>put</b> statements.</p>
<p>
There are 256 <b>char</b> values, corresponding to the distinct patterns in an 8-bit byte. This allows the patterns <i>eos</i> (internal value 0) and <i>uninitchar</i> (internal value 128) to be <b>char</b> values (these patterns are not allowed in the <b>string</b> type; see the <b>string</b> type). All 256 patterns are used, so there is no pattern left to be the "uninitialized value". Uninitialized checking is not done for the <b>char</b> type.</p>
<p>
The <b>ord</b> and <b>chr</b> functions convert between the <b>char</b> values and their corresponding numeric representation in a byte. See <b>ord</b> and <b>chr</b>.</p>
<p>
In general, you can freely intermix the values of the types <b>char</b>, <b>char</b>(<i>n</i>) and <b>string</b>. This means that catenation (+), comparisons, <b>length</b> and substrings can be applied to any of these types. See <b>char</b>(<i>n</i>) for details about conversions between <b>char</b>, <b>char</b>(<i>n</i>) and <b>string</b>.</p>
