			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>Window.GetActive</b> function returns the window ID of the 
          active window. If the active window is a Turing run window, then
	  <b>Window.GetActive</b> returns <b>defWinID</b> (which is -1) if 
	  the window is the default run window, or whatever number was 
	  returned from <b>Window.Open</b> for any other run window. 
	  If the active window is not a run window, then it returns -5 
	  and sets <b>Error.Last</b> and <b>Error.LastMsg</b> to indicate 
	  the fact.<p>
	  An active window is defined as the window that has the input focus. 
	  This means that any typing will be sent to the active window. Under 
	  most systems an active window is indicated by a change in the 
	  appearance of the window.</p>
