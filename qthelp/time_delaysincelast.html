			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b> ( <i>duration</i> : <b>int</b> )<p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b> procedure is used to cause the 
          program to pause for a given time since the last call to 
          <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b>. The time duration is in milliseconds.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program outputs from 1 to 100,000, then outputs how long it 
          took to do this (in milliseconds). It then calls <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b>
          to wait until 10 seconds has passed since the beginning of the
          program (regardless of how long it took to execute the loop). Finally
          it outputs how many milliseconds has passed since the program started.
          This should be close to 10,000 milliseconds.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var t : int := Time.Elapsed
        put "Starting now, count to 100,000"
        for i : 1 .. 100000
            put i ..
            locate (whatrow, 1)
        end for
        put "Finished counting to 100,000"
        
        put "Elapsed time: ", Time.Elapsed - t, " milliseconds"
        Time.DelaySinceLast (10000)
        put "Elapsed time: ", Time.Elapsed - t, " milliseconds"
    </code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b> is usually used to time a process so 
          that it operates on the same speed no matter what the machine. For 
          example, in the above example, the program will alwyas take 10 
          seconds to execute, regardless of the speed of the machine (up to 
          a point). Fast machines will spend little time in the <b>for</b>
          loop and longer waiting to return from <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b>.
          Slower machines will take longer to execute the loop and will 
          consequently wait less time before returning from 
          <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b>.<p>
          The <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b> procedure is often used to time the 
          speed of animation in games.</p>
<p>
          Note that this only works up to a point. On a very slow machine, the
          <b>for</b> loop may take longer than 10 seconds to execute, in which
          case the call to <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b> will return instantly.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
          This means that you can only call the function by calling 
          <b>Time.DelaySinceLast</b>, not by calling <b>DelaySinceLast</b>.</p>
