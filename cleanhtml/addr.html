			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>addr</b> (<i>reference</i>)<p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>addr</b> attribute is used to find the integer address of a variable or non scalar constant. This is implementation-dependent. This address may be used in an indirection operation <b>@</b>.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			Set <i>a</i> to be the address of <i>x</i>.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var x : real
        var a : addressint := addr (x)</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The value of the address produced by <b>addr</b> is of type <b>addressint</b>, an integer type whose range is that of the underlying memory addresses.<p>
The concept of an address is implementation-dependent. For example, an optimizing compiler could determine that a variable does not require space because the program could be computed without the variable with no change in output. However, in most implementations, types have a predictable size and variables of that type occupy that number of bytes in memory.</p>
