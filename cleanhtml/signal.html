			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			A <i>signalStatement</i> is:<p>
</p>
<table><tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="8"><font size="+1"><b>signal</b> <i>variableReference</i></font></td>
</tr></table>
<p></p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			A <b>signal</b> statement is used in a concurrent program to wake up a process that is blocked (waiting on a condition variable). The statement can only be used inside a monitor (a special kind of module that handles concurrency). A <b>signal</b> statement operates on a <b>condition</b> variable (the <i>variableReference</i>), which is essentially a queue of sleeping processes. See <b>condition</b> for an example of a <b>signal</b> statement.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			A <b>signal</b> statement wakes up one process that is doing a <b>wait</b> on the specified condition queue, if such a process exists. If the condition is deferred (or <b>timeout</b>; see <b>condition</b>), the signaler continues in the monitor, and the awakened process is allowed to continue only when the monitor becomes inactive. A signal to an <i>immediate</i> (non-deferred) condition causes the signaled process to begin running in the monitor immediately. The signaling process waits to re-enter the monitor when the monitor becomes inactive.<p>
