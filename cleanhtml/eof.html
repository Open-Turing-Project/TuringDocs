	<h1>eof</h1>
	
		
		

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>eof</b> (<i>streamNumber</i> : <b>int</b>) : <b>boolean</b><p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>eof</b> (end of file) function is used to determine if there 
          is any more input. It returns <b>true</b> when there are no more 
          characters to be read. The parameter and its parentheses are omitted 
          when referring to the standard input (usually this is the keyboard); 
          otherwise the parameter specifies the number of a stream. The stream 
          number has been determined (in most cases) by an <b>open</b> 
          statement.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program reads and outputs all the lines in the file called 
          "info".<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var line : string
        var fileNumber : int
        open : fileNumber, "info", get
        loop
            exit when eof (fileNumber)
            get : fileNumber, line : *
            put line
        end loop</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			See also the description of the <b>get</b> statement, which gives 
          more examples of the use of <b>eof</b>. See also the <b>open</b> 
          and <b>read</b> statements.<p>
          When the input is from the keyboard, the user can signal end-of-file 
          by typing control-Z on a PC (or control-D on UNIX). If a program 
          tests for <b>eof</b> on the keyboard, and the user has not typed 
          control-Z (or control-D) and the user has typed no characters beyond 
          those that have been read, the program must wait until the next 
          character is typed. Once this character is typed, the program 
          knows whether it is at the end of the input, and returns the 
          corresponding <b>true</b> or <b>false</b> value for <b>eof</b>.</p>

			<h2>Example</h2>
			Another example is available that illustrates detecting EOF from
          the keyboard.<p>
