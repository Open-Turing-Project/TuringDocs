			<font size="+1"><b>Sprite.SetFrameRate</b> (<i>framesPerSec</i> : <b>int</b>)<p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			Specifies the maximum number of times per second that sprite positions
          will be changed on the screen.  The higher the number, the smoother
          the animation will appear (and the more processor time will be used
          to perform the animation).

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			When you change the position or appearance of a sprite, Turing does
          not update the window immediately.  Instead, it waits a certain length
          of time and then updates all sprites that have moved since the last
          update.  This allows for relatively smooth animation.<p>
          This means that you have a simple loop that calls Sprite.SetPosition
          200 times a second, the image of the sprite on the screen is still
          only being moved (by default) 33 times a second.
          </p>
<p>
          You can specify how many times a second Turing checks to see if a 
          sprite has moved by using the <b>Sprite.SetFrameRate</b> procedure.
          Rates of 5-10 will make the movement of the sprites seem very 
          choppy.  Rates of 100 are more or less completely smooth (the 
          maximum is 120) and most CRT's will not notice any difference after
          60.  The default rate is 33 frames per second.  You should note that
          if you set the rate higher than your computer can handle, every other
          part of your program will slow down as Turing will be checking for
          sprite movement rather than executing your program.
          </p>
<p>
          A modern PC (2+ GHz with a decent graphics card) can probably handle
          a frame rate of 60+, depending on the number of sprites.  A 
          Pentium III should probably use the default rate.  Slower machines
          should probably use a lower rate (around 20).  Experimentation is
          the best way to determine the ideal frame rate.</p>

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
          This means that you can only call the function by calling 
          <b>Sprite.SetFrameRate</b>, not by calling <b>SetFrameRate</b>.</p>
