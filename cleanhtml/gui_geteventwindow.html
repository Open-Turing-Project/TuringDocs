			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>GUI.GetEventWindow</b> : <b>int</b><p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			Returns the window ID of the window in which the event (mouse button or keystroke) took place. This function should only be called in an <i>action procedure</i> or in a default mouse or keystroke event handler, as it will return 1 when there is no event being processed.<p>
This function is commonly used when several windows share the same layout. The same buttons in each window point to the same <i>action procedures</i>. To determine which button was actually pressed, the function is called to get the window.</p>
<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			The following program creates four windows in a row, each with a button that, when pressed, causes a star to be drawn in that window.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        import GUI in "%oot/lib/GUI" 
        
        procedure DrawStar
            var windowID : int := GUI.GetEventWindow
            Window.Select (windowID)
            Draw.FillStar (25, 40, 175, 190, Rand.Int (10, 15))
        end DrawStar
        
        for i : 0 .. 3
            var window : int := Window.Open ("graphics:200;200") 
            % Place window above task bar, across from previous one.
            Window.SetPosition (window, 220 * i, 27) 
            var button : int := GUI.CreateButton (5, 5, 190, "Draw Star", 
                DrawStar) 
        end for
        
        loop
            exit when GUI.ProcessEvent
        end loop</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
This means that you can only call the function by calling <b>GUI.GetEventWindow</b>, not by calling <b>GetEventWindow</b>.</p>
<p>
