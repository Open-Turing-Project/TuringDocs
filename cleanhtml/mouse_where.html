	<h1>Mouse.Where</h1>
	
		
		

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Mouse.Where </b>(<b>var</b> <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>button</i> : <b>int</b>)<p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>Mouse.Where</b> procedure is used to get current information about the status of the mouse. The parameters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are set to the current location of the mouse cursor. If the program is running on a system using windows, the cursor may be outside the window. This means that <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> may be set to values outside of the bounds of 0 to <b>maxx</b> and 0 to <b>maxy</b>.<p>
The parameter <i>button</i> is set depending on the current mode. In "<i>single-button mode</i>" (where the mouse is treated like a one-button mouse), <i>button</i> is set to 0 if all the mouse buttons are up, and 1 if any of the mouse buttons are down. In "<i>multi-button mode</i>", <i>button</i><b> </b>is assigned the sum of 1 if the left button is down, 10 if the middle button is down, and 100 if the right button is down. Thus if <i>button</i> has the value of 101, then it means that the left and right mouse buttons were depressed.</p>

			<h2>Example</h2>
			A program that displays the status of the mouse at the top left corner of the screen.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var x, y, button : int
        loop
            Mouse.Where (x, y, button)
            Text.Locate (1, 1)
            if button = 0 then
                put x : 4, "  ", y : 4, "  button up"
            else
                put x : 4, "  ", y : 4, "  button down"
            end if
        end loop</code></pre>
