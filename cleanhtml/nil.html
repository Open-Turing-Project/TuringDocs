			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>nil</b> [ (<i>collectionOrClassId</i> ) ]<p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>nil</b> pointer does not locate any element (object). Pointers locate items in collections, classes and types. The <i>collectionOrClassId</i> is optional.<p>
This <b>nil</b> pointer is distinct from pointers to actual elements, and it can be compared to these pointers. It is also distinct from the uninitialized pointer value.</p>
<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			In this example, the pointer called <i>first</i> is set to the nil pointer of collection <i>c</i>, that is, to <b>nil</b>(c).<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var c : collection of
            record
                name : string ( 50 )
                next : pointer to c
            end record
        var first : pointer to c := nil ( c )</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			See also collection, class and pointer. When nil is written without the <i>collectionOrClassId</i>, it can be assigned to a pointer to any collection, class or type.<p>
The type of <b>nil</b> without the <i>collectionOrClassId</i> is effectively a pointer to <i>everyClass</i>, an imaginary class that has no objects and is the descendant of all classes. This implies that it can be assigned to any other class pointer, because it is a descendant of all classes.</p>
<p>
Turing allows you to write <b>nil</b> (<i>id</i>) after a forward declaration of <i>id</i> (the name of a collection, class or type) before (and after) the resolution of the <i>id</i>.</p>
