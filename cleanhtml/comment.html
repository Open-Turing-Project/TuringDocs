			<h2>Description</h2>
			A <i>comment</i> is a remark to the reader of the program, which the computer ignores. The most common form of comment in Turing starts with a percent sign (%) and continues to the end of the current line; this is called an <i>end-of-line </i>comment. There is also the <i>bracketed </i>comment, which begins with the /* and ends with */ and which can continue across line boundaries.<p>

			<pre><code>        % This is an end-of-line comment
        var x : real        % Here is another end-of-line comment
        const s := "Hello"
        /* Here is a bracketed comment that
            lasts for two lines */
        const pi := 3.14159</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			In the BASIC language, comments are called <i>remarks </i>and start with the keyword REM. In Pascal, comments are bracketed by (* and *).<p>
