			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>View.UpdateArea</b> (<i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, <i>y2</i>)<p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>View.UpdateArea</b> procedure updates a rectanglular area 
          Run window, specified by (<i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>) - 
          (<i>x2</i>, <i>y2</i>) from the offscreen bitmap. It is used with 
          the command <b>View.Set</b>&nbsp;("offscreenonly") which prevents the 
          Run window from being updated until the <b>View.UpdateArea</b> 
          or <b>View.Update</b> command is given.<p>
          Because the entire screen is not updated each time, the animation can
          be much faster, especially on slow machines.  This procedure does 
          take more effort to use than <b>View.Update</b> as it requires the 
          programmer to calculate which portion of the screen must be updated.
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program moves a star back and forth across the screen. To
          compare the speed up <b>View.UpdateArea</b> with <b>View.Update</b>,
          replace the calls to <b>View.UpdateArea</b> with <b>View.Update</b>.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        View.Set ("offscreenonly")
        var SIZE : int := 50
        loop
            for x : 0 .. maxx - SIZE
                Draw.FillStar (x, 100, x + SIZE, 100 + SIZE, brightgreen)
                View.UpdateArea (x - 1, 100, x + SIZE, 100 + SIZE)
                Draw.FillStar (x, 100, x + SIZE, 100 + SIZE, colorbg)
            end for
            for decreasing x : maxx - SIZE .. 0
                Draw.FillStar (x, 100, x + SIZE, 100 + SIZE, brightgreen)
                View.UpdateArea (x, 100, x + SIZE + 1, 100 + SIZE)
                Draw.FillStar (x, 100, x + SIZE, 100 + SIZE, colorbg)
            end for
        end loop</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			If the entire screen is being updated each time through the animation
          loop (for example if the background image is changing), then use
          <b>View.Update</b> instead.<p>
          When using <b>View.UpdateArea</b>, it is important to correctly 
          calculate the region to be updated. This region must not only contain
          the item being drawn, but also any area where the background should
          be replaced. For example, in the program above, the area updated 
          included the one pixel to the left of the star when the star was
          moving right-ward and one pixel to the right of the star when the star
          was moving left-ward.</p>

			<h2>Execute</h2>
			Here is an example program that allows you to compare the speed of
          animation using <b>View.Update</b> with <b>View.UpdateArea</b>. The
          program animates an object on a background of stars. Pressing any key
          switches between the two calls.<p>
      	  <object id="launch" type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11" width="120" height="40">
            <param name="Command" value="TCard">
<param name="Button" value="Text: Launch Compare Animation Speed Program">
<param name="Item1" value="-1,CompareAnimationSpeed.t;Compare Animation Speed Example"></object></p>

			<h2>Details</h2>
			All Turing Run windows have both an onscreen visible window and an 
          offscreen window. Whenever any output is sent to the screen, both 
          the onscreen window and the offscreen window are updated. When the 
          Run window needs to be updated (for example when another window is 
          moved over top of it and then removed), Turing copies the offscreen 
          window onto the onscreen window.<p>
          When the <b>View.Set</b>&nbsp;("offscreenonly") command is given, Turing 
          no longer draws to the onscreen window when any drawing command is 
          given. However, it does update the offscreen window. When the 
          <b>View.Update</b> command is given, the entire offscreen window 
          is copied to the onscreen window.</p>
<p>
          This can be used to provide smooth, flicker-free animation. Animated 
          objects flicker when the object being animated disappears from the 
          onscreen window for a period of time. By using 
          <b>View.Set</b>&nbsp;("offscreenonly") / <b>View.Update</b>, the onscreen 
          window is never blank. Instead, the offscreen window drawn over top 
          off the on screen window, replacing it. This means that the on-screen
          window is never blanked out, eliminating the flickering found in 
          the animation.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			It's very easy to forget that no output will appear in the Run 
          window when using <b>View.UpdateArea</b>. Remember to use 
          <b>View.Set</b>("nooffscreenonly") to turn off this feature 
          sending output for debugging purposes.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			<b>View.UpdateArea</b> should not be used in conjunction with the 
          <b>Sprite </b>module. Sprites can be considered a limited version 
          of this technique. <b>View.UpdateArea</b> also works well when the 
          entire background is changing.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
          This means that you can only call the function by calling 
          <b>View.UpdateArea</b>, not by calling <b>UpdateArea</b>.</p>
<p>
