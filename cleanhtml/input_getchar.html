	<h1>Input.getchar</h1>
	
		
		

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>getchar</b> : <b>char</b><p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>getchar</b> function is used to input a single character without waiting for the end of a line. The next character in the keyboard buffer (the oldest not-yet-read character) is returned.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program contains a procedure called <i>getKey </i>which causes the program to wait until a key is pressed.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        View.Set ("graphics")
        
        procedure getKey
            var ch : char
            ch := getchar
        end getKey
        
        for i : 1 .. 1000
            put i : 4, " Pause till a key is pressed"
            getKey
        end for</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The screen should be in a "<i>screen</i>"<i> </i>or "<i>graphics</i>" mode. See the <b>View.Set</b> procedure for details. If the screen is not in one of these modes, it will automatically be set to "<i>screen</i>" mode.<p>
Some keys, such as the left arrow key, insert key, delete key, and function keys do not produce ordinary character values. These keystrokes are returned by <b>getch</b> as special values. See Appendix D for these values.</p>
<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported unqualified.<p>
This means that you can call the function by calling <b>getchar</b> or by calling <b>Input.getchar</b>.</p>
<p>
</p>
