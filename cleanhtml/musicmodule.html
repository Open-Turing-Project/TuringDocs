			<h2>Description</h2>
			This unit contains the predefined subprograms that deal with sound and music. Some of these routines have not been implemented at the time of the writing of this manual and will be implemented in future releases.<p>
All routines in the <b>Music</b> module are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<b>Music.</b>").</p>
