			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Pic.Free</b> (<i>picID</i> : <b>int</b>)<p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<b>Pic.Free </b>is used to release the memory allocated by 
          <b>Pic.New</b>. It frees up the memory allocated to the parameter 
	  <i>picID</i>. This means that <i>picID</i> can not be used in a 
	  <b>Draw.Pic</b> or <b>Draw.Save</b> procedure after <b>Pic.Free</b> 
	  is called.<p>
	  Turing has a limited number of pictures that are available at any
	  one time (approximately 1,000). A program that continuously allocates 
	  pictures (using <b>Pic.New</b> or <b>Pic.FileNew</b>) will eventually 
	  fail if it does not free the pictures using <b>Pic.Free</b>. As well,
	  if a program allocates hundreds of pictures and does not
	  free any of them, the memory devoted to the pictures will 
	  not be freed and eventually the program may exhaust the memory on 
	  the machine.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			If <b>Pic.Free</b> is passed an invalid picture ID, a fatal error 
          occurs. If the <b>Pic.Free</b> call fails for other (non-fatal) 
	  reasons, <b>Error.Last</b> will return a non-zero value indicating 
	  the reason for the failure. <b>Error.LastMsg</b> will return a string 
	  which contains the textual version of the error.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			The program animates a picture moving across a background.  Each
          time the picture is about to move to a new location, a picture of
	  the background at that location is taken. When the picture is to be
	  moved to the next location, the background picture is drawn over top
	  of the picture, thus "erasing" it. The <b>Pic.Free</b> command frees 
	  up each background picture once it is no longer in use. Without it,
	  the program would use up all the picture identifiers and crash after
	  one or two moves across the window.<p>
	  The animation in the example flickers slightly. See 
	  <a href="view_update.html">View.Update</a> for information on 
	  how to produce flicker-free animation.</p>

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
	  This means that you can only call the function by calling 
	  <b>Pic.Free</b>, not by calling <b>Free</b>.</p>
