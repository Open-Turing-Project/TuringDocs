			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Music.Sound</b> ( <i>frequency</i>, <i>duration</i> : <b>int </b>)<p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>Music.Sound </b>statement is used to cause the computer to 
	  sound a note of a given frequency for a given time. The frequency 
	  is in cycles per second (Hertz). The time duration is in milliseconds. 
	  For example, middle A on a piano is 440 Hertz, so 
	  <b>Music.Sound</b>(440, 1000) plays middle A for one second.<p>
	  Sounds are produced synchronously on a per process basis. This means 
	  that when a process executes a <b>Music.Sound</b> or <b>Music.Play</b> 
	  command, it stops until the command is finished. However, other 
	  processes will continue executing.</p>

                    Music.Sound ( i, 50 )   % Sound note
                end for
                for decreasing i : 2900 .. 200 by 100
                    Music.Sound ( i, 50 )   % Sound note
                end for
            end loop
        end siren
        
        fork siren
         the rest of the program goes here while the siren continues </code></pre>
