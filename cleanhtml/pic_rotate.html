	<h1>Pic.Rotate</h1>
	
		
		

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Pic.Rotate</b> (<i>picID</i>, <i>angle</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> : <b>int</b>) : <b>int</b><p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<b>Pic.Rotate </b>is used to create a new picture by rotating an 
	  already existing picture. Rotation can either be around a specific 
	  point in the picture (often used for rotating a picure in place) or 
	  just a general rotation.<p>
	  The <i>angle</i> is specified in degrees. The rotation is done in a 
	  counter-clockwise direction. The original picture is not modified by 
	  the call to <b>Pic.Rotate</b> and must still be freed when no longer 
	  used. The picture produced by <b>Pic.Rotate</b> may be a different 
	  size than the original picture.</p>
<p>
	  The (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) point is the point around which the rotation 
	  is to take place and is relative to the picture being rotated. If it 
	  is not important to rotate the picture in place, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> 
	  should be set to -1, which make the new picture the minimum size 
	  required to fit the rotated image.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The <b>Pic.Rotate</b> command can fail, in which case it returns 0. 
          The <b>Error.LastMsg</b> function can then be used to obtain more 
	  information about the failure.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are set to a point in the picture (rather 
          than 1), it is possible for parts of the original picture to be 
	  rotated off the left and bottom edge of the new picture. This occurs 
	  because <b>Pic.Rotate</b> guarantees that the point specified by  
	  (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) in the original picture will be located at  
	  (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) in the rotated picture. You can avoid losing
	  parts of the picture by making certain there is a margin of background
	  color on the left and bottom sides of the picture.<p>
	  </p>

	  As well, any pixels in the rotated picture that were not part of the 
	  original picture are set to the background color.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Rotation can be slow on older machines. Programs that are using 
          animation should create and store all the rotated images that may 
	  be needed. Often pictures of an object at various angles are stored 
	  in an array. <p>

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program draws &#147;Hello&#148; on the screen rotated at 0, 45 and 90 
          degrees.<p>

	  <center><b>Output from Program</b></center>
<p>
    </p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        View.Set ("graphics:200;150,nobuttonbar")
        var f : int := Font.New ("Serif:36")
        Font.Draw ("Hello", 10, 10, f, black)
        var pic : int := Pic.New (5, 5, 120, 45)
        var pic45 : int := Pic.Rotate (pic, 45, -1, -1)
        var pic90 : int := Pic.Rotate (pic, 90, -1, -1)
        Pic.Draw (pic45, 5, 50, picCopy)
        Pic.Draw (pic90, 150, 5, picCopy)
        </code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program moves a spinning &#147;Hello&#148; around the screen, bouncing it off the edges of the output window. Notice that the original picture contains adequate space on the left and bottom sides to contain the rotation.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        View.Set ("graphics:300;250,nobuttonbar")
        var pic : array 0 .. 35 of int
        var f : int := Font.New ("Serif:36")
        const CTR : int := 57
        Font.Draw ("Hello", 5, 45, f, black)
        Draw.FillOval (CTR, CTR, 3, 3, brightred)
        pic (0) := Pic.New (0, 0, 115, 115)
        cls
        for angle : 1 .. 35
            pic (angle) := Pic.Rotate (pic (0), angle * 10, CTR, CTR)
        end for
        
        var x : int := CTR
        var y : int := CTR
        var dx : int := 1
        var dy : int := 1
        loop
            for angle : 0 .. 35
                Pic.Draw (pic (angle), x  - CTR, y - CTR, picCopy)
                if x + dx < CTR or x + dx > maxx - CTR then
                    dx := dx
                end if
                if y + dy < CTR or y + dy > maxy - CTR then
                    dy := dy
                end if
                x += dx
                y += dy
                delay (50)
            end for
        end loop</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Note that the rotated picture is a newly created picture. When it 
          is no longer needed, its memory should be released by using 
	  <b>Pic.Free</b>.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
	  This means that you can only call the function by calling 
	  <b>Pic.Rotate</b>, not by calling <b>Rotate</b>.</p>
<p>
    </p>
