			<h2>Syntax</h2>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<b>Pic.DrawSpecial</b> is used to draw a picture on the screen with a
          special effect such as a wipe, a slide, or a fade-in. 
          The picture is drawn with the lower left corner at 
          (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>). The <i>duration</i> specifies how long the
          transition should take in milliseconds.  For example, a fade-in could
          be specified to last 1/2 a second by using a duration of 500.<p>
	  The <i>mode</i> parameter is the same as in <b>Pic.New</b> and has 
	  one of the following values:</p>
<p>
	  </p>
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><i>picCopy</i></td>
	      <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>This draws the picture on top of what was underneath, 
	          obscuring it completely.</td>
	    </tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><i>picXor</i></td>
	      <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>This draws the picture XORing it with the background. 
	          In DOS, you can use this function to do animation. 
		  Drawing an object on top of itself with XOR erases 
		  it and restores the background.</td>
	    </tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><i>picMerge</i></td>
	      <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>This draws the picture like <i>picCopy</i> except 
	          that any occurrence of the background color in the 
		  picture is not drawn to the screen. This allows you 
		  to draw an irregularly-shaped object and draw it to 
		  the screen.</td>
	    </tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><i>picUnderMerge</i></td>
	      <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>This draws the picture, but only where the background 
	          color was displayed underneath it. The effect of this 
		  is to make the picture appear to be displayed behind 
		  the background.</td>
	    </tr>

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The <b>Pic.DrawSpecial</b> requires a moderately fast machine to 
          operate successfully (Pentium III or higher). The <i>picFadeIn</i>
          and <i>picBlend</i> transitions do not work well on 8-bit (256 color)
	  displays.  On Microsoft Windows machines, you can determine the 
	  bit-depth of the display (the number of colors available) by 
	  selecting the <i>Display</i> control panel from the <i>Start</i> 
	  menu.  You can also use the<p>
	  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	  <b>Config.Display</b> (<b>cdNumMaxColors</b>)</tt></p>
<p>
	  function to determine the bit-depth of the display (anything 
	  <b>over</b> 256 colors will produce acceptable results).</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			If the <b>Pic.DrawSpecial</b> call fails, <b>Error.Last</b> will return a 
          non-zero value indicating the reason for the failure. 
	  <b>Error.LastMsg</b> will return a string which contains the textual 
	  version of the error.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			The program draws a blue star on the screen, then a red circle, then
          proceeds to have to have the two replace each other with a variety of
          transitions.<p>
</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var redID, blueID: int
        var x, y : int
        Draw.FillStar (50, 50, 150, 150, brightred)
        redID := Pic.New (50, 50, 150, 150)
        cls
        Draw.FillOval (100, 100, 50, 50, brightblue)
        blueID := Pic.New (50, 50, 150, 150)
	Pic.DrawSpecial (redID, 50, 50, picCopy, picWipeLeftToRight, 500)
	Pic.DrawSpecial (blueID, 50, 50, picCopy, picWipeTopToBottom, 500)
	Pic.DrawSpecial (redID, 50, 50, picCopy, picSlideLeftToRight, 500)
	Pic.DrawSpecial (blueID, 50, 50, picCopy, picSlideTopToBottom, 500)
	Pic.DrawSpecial (redID, 50, 50, picCopy, picFadeIn, 1000)

			<h2>Execute</h2>
			The following program demonstrates each of the different special 
          effects, first using pictures containing text, then pictures
          loaded from photographs, then both at once.<p>
          <object id="launch" type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11" width="120" height="40">
	    <param name="Command" value="TCard">
<param name="Button" value="Text: Launch Example Program">
<param name="Item1" value="-1,Pic.DrawSpecial2.t;Pic.DrawSpecial2 Example"></object></p>
<p></p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
	  This means that you can only call the function by calling 
	  <b>Pic.DrawSpecial</b>, not by calling <b>DrawSpecial</b>.</p>
<p>
    </p>
