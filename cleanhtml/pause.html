			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			A <i>pauseStatement</i> is:<p>
</p>
<table><tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="8"><font size="+1"><b>pause</b> <i>expn</i></font></td>
</tr></table>
<p></p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>pause</b> statement blocks the program (or just the process in the case of a concurrent program) for a given number of simulated time units. The <i>expn</i> must be a non-negative <b>int</b> value giving the number of time units. This is analogous to the <b>delay</b> statement, which causes blocking for a given amount of real time (actual physical time).<p>
The interpreter maintains a counter which it considers to be simulated time. The only execution that causes this counter to increase is the <b>pause</b> statement. The process executing the <b>pause</b> is blocked until the counter has counted forward the number of units given by <i>expn</i>. All other statements (except <b>wait</b>) are considered to be infinitely fast. Several processes can be executing <b>pause</b> statements simultaneously.</p>
<p>
The use of simulated time allows Turing to be used as a simulation language in which the <b>pause</b> statement simulates the passage of time in the simulated system.</p>
