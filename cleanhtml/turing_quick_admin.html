<h1>Turing Teacher/Administrator Quick Start Guide</h1>
This guide is designed to be the minimal information that you should read if
you are teaching courses using Turing 4.0 or are in charge of administering 
Turing 4.0
<p>
This guide provides information on the Turing environment (the editor, the
run windows, etc.)  It does <b>not</b> provide any information on the Turing
programming language itself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note, if you have any questions not answered here, please check with the 
<a href="turing_admin.html">Turing Teacher/Administrator's Complete Guide</a>
for more information.</b>

<a name="1"></a>1. Making Certain You Have the Lastest Version</h2>
  Turing 4.0 is updated regularly.  To find out what version you
  are currently running, click the <b>About Turing</b> menu item in the 
  <b>Help</b> menu.  To find out the current version of Turing, go to
  <a href="http://www.holtsoft.com/turing/support/#currentversion">
  http://www.holtsoft.com/turing/support/#currentversion</a>. This lists the
  current version of the software.
  <p>
  This page also lists which bugs have been fixed and when new features have
  been added.  The page also contains a section 
  (<a href="http://www.holtsoft.com/turing/support/#turing4patches">
  http://www.holtsoft.com/turing/support/#turing4patches</a>)
  where a file can be downloaded that will update most versions of Turing to 
  the latest version.  
  </p>
<p>
  If you are a teacher or an administrator at a school and require a complete 
  installation file (as opposed to the publically available patch), contact Tom
  West at (416) 978-8363.

<h2>
<a name="2"></a>2. Mandatory Administration Issues</h2>
  Turing 4.0 has been designed to run on either a network or installed on 
  individual stand-alone machines.  Running on a network is often preferred
  because of ease of administration. However, Turing, like any other application
  will load somewhat faster when it is launched if it is stored locally.
  <p>
  There are only two administration issues that must be addressed to configure 
  Turing properly.
  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Set the start-in (often called the "working") directory properly.</b>
    	<p>
        It is important that the <b>start-in</b> directory for Turing be 
        set to the student's home directory.  This is done by setting the
        <b>start-in</b> (or <b>working</b>) directory of the shortcut or 
        menu item used to launch Turing to the drive mapped to the student's 
        home directory.
        </p>
<p>
  	The shortcut's working directory can be modified by
	changing it's start-in or working directory property. (To display the
	<b>Properties</b> dialog box, right click on the shortcut or menu item 
	and select Properties from the pop-up menu.)
	</p>
<p> 
  	</p>
<center>
    	  <img src="turing_admin03.gif"><br><b>Properties for a Shortcut under Windows 2000</b>
  	</center>
	<p> 
	This requires that you have write 
	access to the shortcut.  Note that commercial menu front-ends have
	their own way of setting the start-in directory of applications.
	</p>
<p>
	If there is no drive mapped to the student's home directory, or this 
	method is not applicable to your system setup, please check with the 
        <a href="turing_admin.html#working_dir">Turing Teacher/Administrator's Complete Guide</a>
	for more information.
	</p>
<p>
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Set either Beginner or Regular Mode for Students.</b>
    	<p>
        Turing can be set to <b>Beginner</b> mode, in which case only one
	file is open at a time.  Opening up another file closes the first one.
	When the program is running, the Editor window minimizes. In this way,
	only one window is usually visible at a time. In this fashion, 
	<b>Beginner</b> mode is similar to the old DOS Turing.</p>
<p>
	In <b>Regular</b> mode, any number of files can be opened and each
	appears in its own editor window.
	</p>
<p>
	In general, we suggest <b>Beginner</b> mode for grade 9 and 10 and
	<b>Regular</b> mode for all others.  If you are using <b>Beginner</b>
	mode, we suggest that you point out to the students that they can use
	the Prefences to change to <b>Regular</b> mode when they feel 
	comfortable with the environment.
	</p>
<p>
	To change the mode (or to make any other change to the system 
	preferences), you must open a DOS window, <b>cd</b> to the directory 
	in which the Turing executable (<b>turing.exe</b>) is located and 
	issue the command:
	</p>
<p>
	</p>
<center><b>turing  -admin</b></center>
	<p>
	This will cause Turing to start in <b>Administrator mode</b>, 
	displaying the following dialog box:
	</p>
<p> 
  	</p>
<center>
    	  <img src="turing_admin01.gif"><br><b>Administration Mode Notification</b>
  	</center>
	<p> 
  	Selecting <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>File</b> menu will display 
  	a tabbed dialog box of all the Turing preferences.  
	</p>
<p> 
	</p>
<center>
  	  <img src="turing_quick_admin01.gif"><br><b>Preferences in Administrator Mode</b>
  	</center>
	<p> 
  	Set (or unset) the <b>Beginner Mode</b> preference, click the <b>OK</b>
  	button and quit Turing.  Of course, you can change any other preferences
  	that you would like.  Any changes that you make here will affect all 
  	those using Turing.
  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
<a name="3"></a>3. Using the Parallel Ports in Turing 4</h2>
  Turing 4.0 supports the <b>parallelput</b> and <b>parallelget</b> commands
  to allow you to set the pins on the parallel port low and high.  If you are
  running under Windows NT, 2000 or XP, you will need to install a device
  driver on each machine.  Instructions for doing so can be found 
  <a href="turing_admin.html#parallel">here</a>.  If <b>parallelput</b> and 
  <b>parallelget</b> do not seem to function, you may need to change their
  BIOS settings.  You can get information on how to do that 
  <a href="turing_admin.html#parallel">here</a>.
  
<h2>
<a name="4"></a>4. Student Distribution of Turing 4.0</h2>
  The Ontario Ministry license does not include the right to redistribute the 
  software to students. If you wish to give the software to students, a 
  separate license must be obtained directly from Holt Software. 
  <p>
  If your school does not have such a license, students can purchase the 
  software for home use by printing and then mailing an order form found
  <a href="http://www.holtsoft.com/studentbuy">http://www.holtsoft.com/studentbuy</a>.  
  This order form can also be used to allow interested students to purchase 
  textbooks.
  </p>
<p>
  If your school has purchased a redistribution license (almost 200 schools have
  done so), then you may redistribute the Turing software to your students. 
  You can either burn copies of the CD to distribute to students or place the 
  Turing installer file onto your school Internet server and give your students 
  the URL. 
  </p>
<p>
  <b>If you place this file on your school internet server, you must not make 
  any links from your web pages to the software.</b>
  </p>
<p>
  This will prevent other users of the web from downloading your software. If 
  you place links from your school's web site, then at some point a web search 
  engine will find the software and post its location to the internet at large, 
  allowing for large scale piracy (and a very overloaded school web server). 
  If there are no links to the software, then only those who have been told 
  the exact URL will be able to download the software.
  </p>
<p>
  Note that if you are copying a number of different programs onto a single 
  CD for redistribution, you may rename the Turing installer program to 
  something more descriptive.
  </p>
<p>
  Permanent student redistribution licenses can be purchased for $500-$750 
  for most schools. If you are interested in purchasing a student 
  redistribution license, contact Chris Stephenson at (416) 978-6476 or 
  <a href="mailto:chris@hsa.on.ca">chris@hsa.on.ca</a>
