			<h2>Description</h2>
			A condition is essentially a queue of sleeping processes. It is used in a concurrent program to allow processes to block themselves (by the <b>wait</b> statement) and later to be awakened (by the <b>signal</b> statement). A condition variable, which can occur only inside a monitor (a special kind of module that handles concurrency) or monitor class, is used by the <b>wait</b> and <b>signal</b> statements for putting processes to sleep and later waking them up.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			The processes use this monitor to gain exclusive access to a resource. A process wanting to use the resource calls the <i>request</i> entry point and is blocked until the resource is free. When the process is finished with the resource, it calls the <i>release</i> entry point. This monitor is essentially a binary <i>semaphore</i> in which the semaphore's <i>P</i> operation is the <i>request</i> and the <i>V</i> is the <i>release</i>.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        monitor resource
            export request, release
        
            var available : boolean := true
            var nowAvailable : condition
        
            procedure request
                if not available then
                    wait nowAvailable   % Go to sleep
                end if
                assert available
                available := false      % Allocate resource
            end request
        
            procedure release
                assert not available    % Resource is allocated
                available := true       % Free the resource
                signal nowAvailable % Wake up one process
                                % If any are sleeping
            end release
        
        end resource
        process worker
            loop
                
                resource.request        % Block until available
                 use resource 
                resource.release
            end loop
        end worker
        
        fork worker             % Activate one worker
        fork worker             % Activate another worker</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			A <i>conditionOption </i>is one of:<p>
</p>
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td>(a)</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>priority</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td>(b)</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>deferred</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td>(c)</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>timeout</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The <b>priority</b> option requires that the corresponding <b>wait</b> statements include priorities. Options (b) and (c) declare <i>deferred</i> conditions. A signal to a deferred condition causes the signaled process to become ready to enter the monitor when the monitor becomes inactive. The signaling process continues running in the monitor. A signal to an <i>immediate</i> (non deferred) condition causes the signaled process to begin running in the monitor immediately. The signaling process waits to re-enter the monitor when the monitor becomes inactive. All conditions in a device monitor must be deferred (or <b>timeout</b>).</p>
<p>
A <b>timeout</b> option means the signaling is deferred and that an extra parameter to the <b>wait</b> statement must give a <i>timeout</i> <i>interval</i>. If a process waits longer than its interval, it is automatically signaled. Beware that the <i>empty</i> function can be non-repeatable when applied to timeout conditions. For example, <b>empty</b>(<i>c</i>)<i> </i>may not be equal to <b>empty</b>(<i>c</i>) in a single expression. In the current (1999) version of Turing, the time for time outs is measured in simulation time rather than real time. See the <b>pause</b> statement.</p>
<p>
Conditions cannot be named as types, cannot be contained in records, unions or collections and cannot be declared in statements (such as <b>begin</b> or <b>loop</b>) or in subprograms. They can only be declared in monitors and monitor classes.</p>
<p>
There is no guaranteed order of progress among awakened deferred processes, processes signaling immediate conditions, and processes attempting to enter an active monitor.</p>
<p>
Note that <i>conditionOption</i> must precede the keyword <b>condition</b>.</p>
