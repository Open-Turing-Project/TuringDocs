			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>GUI.GetVersion</b> : <b>int</b><p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			Returns the current version of the GUI Procedure Library. Because the GUI Procedure Library is expected to grow, new versions will probably be made available at our web site <b>http://www.holtsoft.com/turing</b>. If you wish to use features that do not appear in earlier versions of the library, you can have your program check that the current available version meets the programs needs. <b>GUI.GetVersion </b>returns an integer from 100 - 999 and is read as 1.00 to 9.99.<p>
</p>

			<pre><code>        import GUI in "%oot/lib/GUI"
        if GUI.GetVersion < 110 then
            put "You must update to at least version 1.1 of the"
            put "GUI Procedure Library to use this program."
