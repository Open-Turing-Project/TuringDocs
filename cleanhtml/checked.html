			<h2>Description</h2>
			Unchecked means that certain run time tests, which take place by default, can be eliminated, usually to make the program more efficient at the risk of unreliability. The keyword <b>checked</b>, used as a statement, requests that the disabling of checking, previously requested by the keyword <b>unchecked</b>, be re-enabled. See <b>unchecked</b> for details and an example.<p>
