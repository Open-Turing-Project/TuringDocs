			<h2>Description</h2>
			This unit contains the predefined subprograms that deal with I/O streams. The basic I/O in Turing is done with I/O statements. However, extra functions are all part of the <b>Stream </b>unit.<p>
All routines in the <b>Stream</b> unit are exported qualified (and thus must be prefaced with "<b>Stream.</b>"), with the exception of <b>eof</b> which is part of the language but conceptually part of this unit and is considered to be exported unqualified.</p>
