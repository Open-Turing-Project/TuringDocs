			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			A <i>setConstructor</i> is:<p>
</p>
<table><tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="8"><font size="+1"><i>setTypeId</i> ( <i>membersOfSet</i> )</font></td>
</tr></table>
<p></p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			Each value of a <b>set</b> type consists of a set of elements. In classical mathematics, the set consisting of 0 and 1 is written as {0,1}. This is written in Turing using a <i>set constructor</i> consisting of the name of the set type (<i>setTypeId</i>) followed by a parenthesized list of elements.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			The <i>smallSet </i>type is declared so that it can contain any and all of the values 0, 1 and 2. Variable <i>s</i> is initialized to be the set containing 1 and 2. The set {0,1} is written in this Turing example as <i>smallInt</i> (0,1).<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        type smallSet : set of 0 .. 2
        var s : smallSet := smallSet ( 0, 1 )
        
        if 2 in s then </code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The form of <i>membersOfSet</i> is one of:<p>
</p>
The empty set is written, for example, as <i>smallInt </i>(). The full set is written as <i>smallInt </i>(<b>all</b>), so <i>smallInt </i>(<b>all</b>) = <i>smallInt </i>(0,1,2). See also the <b>set</b> type.<p>
The syntax of <i>setConstructor</i> as given above has been simplified by ignoring the fact that <b>set</b> types can be exported from modules. When a <b>set</b> type is exported and used outside of a module, you must write the module name, a dot and then the type name. For example, the set constructor above would be written as <i>m.smallSet</i>(1,2), where <i>m</i> is the module name.</p>

        (b) all         % All member of index type of set
        (c)             % Nothing, meaning the empty set</code></pre>
