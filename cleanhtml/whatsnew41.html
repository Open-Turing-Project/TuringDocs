  <h1>What's New in Turing 4.1</h1>
  
  Turing 4.1 introduces a number of new features.  This page shows some of
  these features.
  
  <ol>
<li>
<h2>Sprite</h2>
        The Turing <b>Sprite</b> module allows users to create animation without
        having to worry about erasing and drawing the objects on the screen. A
        sprite is created from a picture, and then commands by the program
        to move the sprite to the desired location.  The program then 
        automatically erases the sprite at the old location (restoring the 
        background) and redraws it at the new location (placing it underneath
        "higher" sprites, if necessary).<p>
        Here is an example of a program that used sprites.  Each triangle is
        a sprite, and the height of each sprite appears on the sprite.  Sprites
        with a height of -1 or -2 actually <i>behind</i> the background, which
        in this case is a set if green and blue bars.  Note how sprites with a
        higher depth always appear above a sprite with a lower depth. </p>

          <param name="Command" value="TCard">
<param name="Button" value="Text: Launch Sprite Example Program">
<param name="Item1" value="-1,Sprite.t;Sprite Example"></object></p>
<p>
        Here is a second example of a sprite being used to animate a figure
        moving across the screen.  In this case, the figure is taken from a
        multi-frame GIF file and the sprite module is used to make it appear to
        move.</p>
<p>
        <object id="launch" type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11" width="120" height="40">
          <param name="Command" value="TCard">
<param name="Button" value="Text: Launch Sprite Example Program">
<param name="Item1" value="-1,Sprite.Animate.t;Sprite Example"></object></p>
<p>
        The Sprite module is fully documented 
        <b><a href="spritemodule.html">here</a></b>.</p>
<p>
    </p>

<h2>Special Effects</h2>
<p>
        Turing supports a veriety of special effects.  These are obtained by 
        drawing a picture (obtained using the
        <b><a href="pic_new.html">Pic.New</a></b>, 
        <b><a href="pic_filenew.html">Pic.FileNew</a></b>, or the new 
        <b><a href="pic_filenewframes.html">Pic.FileNewFrames</a></b> functions).
        When the picture is drawn, the programmer can specify the transition 
        that should be used to display the new picture.  These transitions can
        includes wipes, slides, a growing image, fade-ins, and so on.</p>
<p>
        Here is an example of a program that demonstrates many of these
        transitions.</p>
<p>
        <object id="launch" type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11" width="120" height="40">
          <param name="Command" value="TCard">
<param name="Button" value="Text: Launch Special Effects Example Program">
<param name="Item1" value="-1,Pic.DrawSpecial2.t;Special Effects Example"></object></p>
<p>
        The different transitions are fully documented 
        <b><a href="pic_drawspecial.html">here</a></b>.</p>
<p>        
    </p>

<h3>GIF Image support</h3>
        The <b><a href="pic_filenew.html">Pic.FileNew</a></b> command can now
        read GIF files (now that the patent has expired in Canada).  GIF files
        can specify a "transparent color", and this is supported by Turing.  
        When a GIF with a transparent color is loaded by Turing, the 
        "transparent color" is added to the color palette (if not already 
        present).  If the picture is displayed using the <i>picMerge</i> mode, 
        the "transparent color" will not be displayed. Note that the 
        "transparent color" is a real color.  If you use the <i>picCopy</i> 
        mode, this color is displayed.<p>
        Here is an example of a program displaying a GIF with a transparent
        color.  In this case, the transparent color is dark blue.</p>
<p>
        <object id="launch" type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11" width="120" height="40">
          <param name="Command" value="TCard">
<param name="Button" value="Text: Launch GIF Example Program">
<param name="Item1" value="-1,GIF.t;GIF Example"></object></p>
<p>
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Multi-frame GIF Image support</h3>
        Turing also supports multi-frame GIF images.  A GIF program can contain
        multiple images (this is how animated GIFs work).  The
        <b><a href="pic_filenewframes.html">Pic.FileNewFrames</a><a></a></b> procedure
        can read a multi-frame GIF into an array of integers.  These can then
        be displayed one at a time, or all in one call using the
        <b><a href="pic_drawframes.html">Pic.DrawFrames</a><a></a></b> procedure.<p>
        Here is an example of a program that displays a rotating globe found
        in a multi-frame GIF file using these procedures.</p>
<p>
        <object id="launch" type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11" width="120" height="40">
          <param name="Command" value="TCard">
<param name="Button" value="Text: Launch GIF Example Program">
<param name="Item1" value="-1,Pic.DrawFrames.t;GIF Example"></object></p>
<p>
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Faster animation</h3>
        Turing has been improved to speed up animation when the <i>picMerge</i>
        mode is used.  Speed improvements from 50% to 500% have been reported.<p>
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Other graphic routines</h3>
        Turing now includes the <b><a href="pic_blend.html">Pic.Blend</a></b>
        function to blend two pictures together and the 
        <b><a href="pic_blur.html">Pic.Blur</a></b> function to take an existing
        picture and make it blurry.<p>
  </p>
</li>
