			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>playdone</b> : <b>boolean</b><p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>playdone</b> function is used to determine when notes played by the <b>play</b> procedure have finished sounding.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program sounds the first three notes of the C scale and outputs "All done" as soon as they are finished. Without the loop, the message would come out before the notes are finished.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        play ( "cde" )
        loop
            exit when playdone
        end loop
        put "All done"</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Under some systems such as UNIX, the <b>playdone</b> procedure may be meaningless.<p>
