			<h2>Syntax</h2>

</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>addressint</b> (address integer) type is an integer type whose range of value is the same as that of the underlying computer. This range is, by its nature, implementation-dependent. On 32-bit architectures, it is commonly the same range as <b>nat4</b> (4-byte natural number).<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			Record <i>r</i> contains three fields, one of which has type <b>char</b>(28). Variable <i>a</i> is an integer whose range of values is the same as the addresses of the underlying computer. This assigns <i>B</i> to the seventh character of a record of type <i>r</i> which is assumed to be located at absolute address <i>a</i>.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        type r :
            record
                i : int
                c28 : char (28)
                c11 : char (11)
            end record
        var a : addressint      % An integer
        Â…                   % a is assigned an integer value
        r @ (a) . c28 (7) := 'B'        % Use indirection operator @</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Although <b>addressint</b> is called an integer type, it is commonly equivalent to a natural type such as <b>nat4</b> (for 32-bit machines).<p>
Be careful not to confuse <b>addressint</b> with pointer types. In low level languages such as assembler and C, addresses and pointers are the same. In Turing, however, a pointer is a high level concept that is more abstract than a machine address. A Turing pointer is a reference to an object, and the representation of this reference depends upon the implementation. In current Turing implementations, pointers (which are by default checked) are represented as a time stamp (a unique number) together with an address. The time stamp is used to make sure that the pointer actually locates an object. There are also <b>unchecked</b> pointers. An <b>unchecked</b> pointer's internal representation is a machine address. You can use type cheats (a dangerous feature) to translate between <b>addressint</b> and unchecked pointers. This is meaningful in current implementations.</p>
