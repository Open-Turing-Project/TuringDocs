			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>mod</b><p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>mod</b> (<i>modulo</i>) operator produces the modulo of one number with another. In other words, the result is always a number between 0 and the second operand. If both operands are positive, the result is identical to the remainder operator. For example, 7 <b>mod</b> 2 produces 1 and 12 <b>mod</b> 5 produces 3.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			In this example, <i>hours</i> is the current time. It is moved back and forth by a random amount, but the final result must always be between 1 and 12 (the mod operation produces a number between 0 and 11 and then 0 becomes 12).<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var hours : int := 12
        var hoursPassed : int
        put "The time is now ", hours, " o'clock"
        loop
            randint (hoursPassed, -12, 12)
            exit when hoursPassed = 0
            if hoursPassed < 0 then 
                put hoursPassed, " hours before " ..
            else
                put hoursPassed, " hours later " ..
            end if
            put hours, " o'clock" ..
            hours := (hours + hoursPassed) mod 12
            if hours = 0 then 
                hours = 12
            end if
            put " it was ", hours, " o'clock"
        end loop</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			If the second operand is positive, then the result is always non-negative. Likewise, if the second operand is negative, then the result is always non-positive. If both  operands are negative, the result is the same as the remainder operator.<p>
