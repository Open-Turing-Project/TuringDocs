			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>View.Update</b><p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>View.Update</b> procedure updates a Run window from an 
          offscreen bitmap. It is used with the command 
          <b>View.Set</b>&nbsp;("offscreenonly") which prevents the Run window from 
          being updated until the <b>View.Update</b> command is given.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program displays 30 circles bouncing around the screen. To see
          the effect without <b>View.Update</b>, comment out the line
          <b>View.Set</b>&nbsp;("offscreenonly")<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        % Place some circles around the screen
        const RADIUS : int := 30
        const NUM_BALLS : int := 20
        var x, y, dx, dy, clr : array 1 .. NUM_BALLS of int
        for i : 1 .. NUM_BALLS
            x (i) := Rand.Int (RADIUS, maxx - RADIUS)
            y (i) := Rand.Int (RADIUS, maxy - RADIUS)
            dx (i) := Rand.Int (-3, 3)
            dy (i) := Rand.Int (-3, 3)
            clr (i) := Rand.Int (1, 15)
        end for
        
        % Now, any drawing to the screen won't appear until a 
        % View.Update is given.
        View.Set ("offscreenonly")
        loop
            cls % Clear the offscreen window
            for i : 1 .. NUM_BALLS
                if x (i) + dx (i) < RADIUS or 
                        x (i) + dx (i) > maxx - RADIUS then
                    dx (i) := -dx (i)
                end if
                if y (i) + dy (i) < RADIUS or 
                        y (i) + dy (i) > maxy - RADIUS then
                    dy (i) := -dy (i)
                end if
                x (i) := x (i) + dx (i)
                y (i) := y (i) + dy (i)
                Draw.FillOval (x (i), y (i), RADIUS, RADIUS, clr (i))
            end for
            % All the circles have been drawn.  Now update the screen.
            View.Update
            Time.Delay (5)
        end loop</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			All Turing Run windows have both an onscreen visible window and an 
          offscreen window. Whenever any output is sent to the screen, both 
          the onscreen window and the offscreen window are updated. When the 
          Run window needs to be updated (for example when another window is 
          moved over top of it and then removed), Turing copies the offscreen 
          window onto the onscreen window.<p>
          When the <b>View.Set</b>&nbsp;("offscreenonly") command is given, Turing 
          no longer draws to the onscreen window when any drawing command is 
          given. However, it does update the offscreen window. When the 
          <b>View.Update</b> command is given, the entire offscreen window 
          is copied to the onscreen window.</p>
<p>
          This can be used to provide smooth, flicker-free animation. Animated 
          objects flicker when the object being animated disappears from the 
          onscreen window for a period of time. By using 
          <b>View.Set</b>&nbsp;("offscreenonly") / <b>View.Update</b>, the onscreen 
          window is never blank. Instead, the offscreen window drawn over top 
          off the on screen window, replacing it. This means that the on-screen
          window is never blanked out, eliminating the flickering found in 
          the animation.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			It's very easy to forget that no output will appear in the Run window 
          when using <b>View.Update</b>. Remember to use 
          <b>View.Set</b>("nooffscreenonly") to turn off this feature sending 
          output for debugging purposes.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			<b>View.Update</b> should not be used in conjunction with the 
          <b>Sprite </b>module. Sprites can be considered a limited version 
          of this technique. <b>View.Update</b> also works well when the entire 
          background is changing.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
          This means that you can only call the function by calling 
          <b>View.Update</b>, not by calling <b>Update</b>.</p>
<p>
