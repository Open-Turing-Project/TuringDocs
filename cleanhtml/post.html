			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			An <i>postAssertion</i> is:<p>
</p>
<table><tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="8"><font size="+1"><b>post</b> <i>trueFalseExpn</i></font></td>
</tr></table>
<p></p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			A <b>post</b> assertion is a special form of an <b>assert</b> statement that is used in a procedure or function. It is used to give requirements that the body of the procedure or function is supposed to satisfy. These requirements are given by the <i>trueFalseExpn</i>. After the body has executed and just before the procedure or function returns, the <i>trueFalseExpn </i>is evaluated. If it is true, all is well and execution continues. If it is false, execution is terminated with an appropriate message. See <b>assert</b> statements and <b>procedure</b> and <b>function</b> declarations for more details. See also <b>pre</b> and <b>invariant</b> assertions.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This function is supposed to produce an integer approximation of the square root of integer <i>i</i>. The post condition requires that this result, which is called <i>answer</i>, must be within a distance of 1 from the corresponding <b>real</b> number square root.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        function intSqrt ( i : int) answer : int
            pre i >= 0
            post abs ( answer - sqrt ( i ) ) <= 1
             statements to approximate square root
        end intSqrt</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			A <b>post</b> assertion can also be used in a module, monitor, class or process declaration to make sure that the initialization satisfies its requirements. <p>
