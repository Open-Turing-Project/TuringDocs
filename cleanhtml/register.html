	<h1>register</h1>
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			When a variable, constant or parameter is declared, you can request that the item be placed in a machine register. This should be done only for programs requiring considerable efficiency.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var register counter : int
        const register maxCounter : int := 100
        procedure p ( register x : real )
            Â…
        end p</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			Items can be requested to be in registers only if they are local to a subprogram (not global variables, declared in the main program, a module, monitor or class). Items requested to be in registers cannot be bound to, passed to reference parameters, have their address taken by <b>addr</b>, or  have certain type cheats applied to them (since a machine register has no address).<p>
The request to use a register may be ignored. For example, the current (1999) interpretive implementation uses pseudo-code, which has no machine registers, and so ignores the <b>register</b> keyword. For the syntax of using this keyword, see <b>var</b> declaration, <b>const</b> declaration and <b>paramDeclaration</b>.</p>
