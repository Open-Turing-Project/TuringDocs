			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Music.PlayFile</b> ( <i>fileName</i> : <b>string</b> )<p></p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>Music.PlayFile</b> procedure is used to play a file of music. 
          The file must be in one of the acceptable formats and the machine, 
	  must have the appropriate hardware.<p>
	  The <i>fileName</i> parameter must give the format of the file:</p>
<p>
	  </p>
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>WAV files</td>
	      <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>"WAV:filename" or "filename.WAV"</td>
	    </tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>MP3 files</td>
	      <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>"MP3:filename" or "filename.MP3"</td>
	    </tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="40">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>MIDI files</td>
	      <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>"MIDI:filename" or "filename.MIDI"</td>
	    </tr>
</table>
<p>
	  Sounds are produced synchronously on a per process basis. This means 
	  that when a process executes a <b>Music.Sound</b>, <b>Music.Play</b> 
	  or <b>Music.PlayFile </b>command, it stops until the command is 
	  finished. However, other processes will continue executing.</p>
<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			To play music while performing any other activity, the call to 
          <b>Music.PlayFile</b> must be executed in its own <b>process</b>. 
	  The process is then called using the <b>fork</b> command. When a 
	  <b>fork</b> command is given, execution starts on the process (like 
	  a procedure call) <i>and</i> continues following the <b>fork</b> 
	  command <i>at the same time</i>.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program plays the music in the file "<i>branden3.wav</i>" 
	  while drawing ovals on the screen.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        process DoMusic
            loop
                Music.PlayFile ("branden3.wav")
            end loop
        end DoMusic
        
        fork DoMusic
        var x, y, clr : int
        loop
            x := Rand.Int (0, maxx)
            y := Rand.Int (0, maxy)
            clr := Rand.Int (0, maxcolor)
            Draw.FillOval (x, y, 30, 30, clr)
        end loop</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			To play a sound file requires that the computer be equipped 
	  with a sound card and speakers.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The Turing 4.1 software can play files in the following audio 
          formats: WAVE (.wav) files, MIDI files (.midi or .mid), and MP3 
	  files (.mp3). In general, MIDI files are the most efficient and 
	  thus are the preferred form for longer music pieces like background 
	  music. WAVE files can record anything, not just music, so are often 
	  used for sound effects.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			The Turing 4.1 software can also play music on a compact disk. 
          To play the complete contents of the compact disk, the filename 
	  is &#147;cd&#148;. To play a single track from a compact disk, the filename 
	  is &#147;cd:[track&nbsp;number]&#148;.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        Music.PlayFile ("cd")       % Play the entire CD
        Music.PlayFile ("cd:3")     % Play the third track on the CD
        </code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			On the PC, different formats of music can play simultaneously. This 
	  means that a program might use a MIDI file as a background soundtrack 
	  and then use WAVE files for individual sound effects. The sound 
	  effects would not interfere with the background music. Playing a 
	  second music file with the same format as an already playing piece 
	  immediately halts the first piece and starts the second.  This can 
	  be used to stop a single type of music by playing a short silent 
	  piece of music.<p>
    </p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program bounces a maple leaf around the screen with background 
	  music and a sound effect when the maple leaf hits an edge. When the 
	  user presses any key, the program immediately exits.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        const STAR_SIZE : int := 80
        var pic, x, y, dx, dy : int

        % Play sound effect once.
