			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<font size="+1"><b>Time.Elapsed</b> : <b>int</b><p>
</p></font>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Description</h2>
			The <b>Time.Elapsed </b>function returns the amount of time since a program (process) started running. The number of milliseconds since the program started running is returned.<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			This program tells you how much time it has used.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var timeRunning : int
        timeRunning := Time.Elapsed
        put "This program has run ", timeRunning, " milliseconds"</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Details</h2>
			On IBM PC compatibles, this is the total time since the Turing system was started up. The hardware resolution of duration is in units of 55 milliseconds. For example, <b>Time.Elapsed </b>may be off by as much as 55 milliseconds.<p>
On Apple Macintoshes, this is the total time since the machine was turned on. The hardware resolution of duration is in units of 17 milliseconds (1/60-th of a second).</p>
<p>
</p>

			
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Status</h2>
			Exported qualified.<p>
This means that you can only call the function by calling <b>Time.Elapsed</b>, not by calling <b>Elapsed</b>.</p>
