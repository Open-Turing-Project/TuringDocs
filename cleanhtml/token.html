			<h2>Description</h2>
			A <i>token</i> is essentially a word, a number or a special symbol such as :=. In a Turing program there are four kinds of tokens: keywords such as <b>get</b>, identifiers such as <i>incomeTax</i>, operators and special symbols, such as <b>+</b> and :=, and explicit constants, such as 1.5 and "Hello". Some keywords, such as <b>index</b>, are reserved and cannot be used in programs to name variables, procedures, etc.<p>
A <b>get</b> statement, such as</p>
<p>
</p>
uses <i>token-oriented</i> input. This means that white space (blanks, tabs, etc.) is skipped before reading the input item and after the item (up to the beginning of the next line). See the <b>get</b> statement for details.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        get incomeTax</code></pre>
			

			
			
		
	
		
		

			<h2>Example</h2>
			In this example, the tokens are <b>var</b>,<i> x</i>, :, <b>real</b>, <i>x</i>, := and 9.84.<p>
</p>

			
			
			<pre><code>        var x : real
        x := 9.84</code></pre>
