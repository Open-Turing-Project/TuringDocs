<h1>Turing Debugger Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Turing supports a number of tools to enable users to debug their programs and
examine program execution.  Some of the available tools are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="">Stepping execution</a> a line at a time.
  </li>
<li>
<a href="">Tracing execution</a> with a set pause between 
      lines of execution
  </li>
<li>
<a href="">Setting breakpoints</a> to pause execution at 
      specified points in the program.
  </li>
<li>
<a href="">Viewing all open resources</a> of a program including files, fonts,
      pictures, etc.
</li>
</ul>
As of May 2002, the Turing 4.1 software does not contain the following feature:
<ul><li>View variables.
</li></ul>
This feature will be implemented as time and developer resources permit.

<h2>Displaying The Debugger Menu</h2>
In order to use any of the debugger commands, you need to have the Debugger
menu showing in the Editor window.  By default, the Debugger menu is hidden
in order to simplify the Turing environment for the majority of students not
using the debugger.
<p>
There are two ways that the Debugger menu can be displayed.  You can select
the <b>Show Debugger Menu</b> command in the <b>Run</b> menu.
</p>
<p>

</center>
<p> 
If you are consistenly using the debugger, then you should change the 
Preferences so that the Debugger menu is always displayed.  This can
be done by bringing up the <b>Editor Window</b> pane of the <b>Preferences</b>
dialog box and setting the <b>Always Show 'Debugger' Menu</b> check box.

<p> 
The Debugger menu gives you access to all the debugging features in Turing 4.0.
The following menu options are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Show Debugger Controls</b><br>
      This command causes each Editor window to display a second row of 
      controls at the top of the window (called the Debugger controls) 
      that allow the user to step through a program and trace execution 
      of the program.  When the Debugger controls are visible, then this
      menu item changes to <b>Hide Debugger Controls</b>.

      </center>
      <p> 
  </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Show Breakpoints</b>
      This command causes each Editor window to dislay an area on the left
      where breakpoints can be placed.  A breakpoint is a marker that causes
      the program to pause when execution reaches the marked line.

  </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Clear Breakpoints</b>
      This command quickly eliminates all breakpoints that have been set in 
      any Editor window.       
  </li>
<li>
<b>Show Allocated Objects</b>
      This command shows all the files, fonts, pictures, etc that have been
      opened or created by the program but have not been closed. As the program
      executes, this window updates every time a resource is allocated or freed.

<h2>Turing Execution</h2>
The rest of this document will use some terms that must be understood properly.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Running</b> - A Turing program is running when statements are being
      continuously executed without human intervention.  However, running
      may be stalled while the program is waiting for keyboard input, executing
      a delay statement, etc.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Paused</b> - A Turing program is paused when execution is 
      temporarily halted.  No input is accepted by the program while
      it is paused.  A program can become paused in a variety of ways including:
      <ul>
<li>The user pressing the <b>Pause</b> button.
        </li>
<li>The user pressing a <b>Step</b>, <b>Step Over</b> or 
            <b>Step Return</b> button.
        </li>
<li>Execution reaching a breakpoint.
        </li>
<li>Execution reaching the <b>break</b> statement in a program.
      </li>
</ul>
      When a Turing program is paused, the line in the source code on which 
      the Turing program was about to execute is highlighted.<br>
      In each case, the program can resume running by clicking the 
      <b>Resume</b> button.  The program can also temporarily resume running
      by the user pressing the <b>Step</b>, <b>Step Over</b> or 
      <b>Step Return</b> button.  Once the statement or statements are finished
      running, the program is paused again.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Executing</b> - A program is executing when it is either <b>Running</b>
      or <b>Paused</b>.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Halted</b> - A Turing program is halted when it can no longer 
      executing.  It cannot be resumed and must be started from the beginning
      in order to run it again.  A program can be halted by:
      <ul>
<li>The user pressing the <b>Stop</b> button.
        </li>
<li>A run-time error.
        </li>
<li>The user closing a Run window.
      </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="step"></a>Stepping a Program</h2>
Stepping a program consists of executing a Turing program a line at a time.
After each step command, execution pauses, highlighting the next line to be 
executed.  To step a program, the program must not be running.  The Debugger
controls in the Editor window must be visible.  To step the program, the 
user clicks one of the three buttons in the Debugger Controls:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Step</b> - If the program is halted, this executes the very first
      line of code and then pauses.  If the program is paused, it executes
      the highlighted line of code and then pauses.  If it line of code to
      be executed is a subprogram call, then it enters the subprogram and 
      pauses at the first line of code in the subprogram.  If it is at the
      end of the subprogram, then it leaves the subprogram and pauses at
      the subprogram call.  This command is sometimes called <b>Step Into</b>.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Step Over</b> - This executes a single line of code.  However, if
      the program is paused at a subprogram call, then the entire subprogram
      is executed and execution is paused at the next line after the subprogram
      call.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Step Return</b> - This resumes execution until the execution returns
      from a subprogram. The next line after the subprogram call.  Note that
      if this command is given in the main program, then execution will continue
      until the program terminates.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="trace"></a>Tracing a Program</h2>
Tracing a program is simply executing a program slowly with each line of code
in the program being highlighted as it is executed.  Tracing allows users
to see how control constructs operate.  Unlike stepping, with tracing, execution
continues until it is paused or halted in some other fashion.
<p>
To start a program tracing, the Debugger Controls must be visible.  The user
then clicks the <b>Trace Execution</b> check box.  When the program is next 
running, each time a statement is executed, the line in the source code will be
highlighted.  The speed at which the tracing occurs is controlled by the 
<b>Trace Speed</b> slider found in the Debugger Controls.  When the slider is
on the left, there is essentially no delay between execution of statements.  
(Note that execution will still be much slower than not tracing due to the time
taken to highlight each executing statement.)  When the slider is on the right,
each statement will wait for about 5 seconds after executing before the next
statement is executed.

</p>
<h2>
<a name="bp"></a>Setting Breakpoints</h2>
Often only a particular section of code is of interest to the user. Breakpoints 
provide a mechanism for pausing a program only when execution reaches a 
specified statement.  To set breakpoints, they need to be displayed in the 
Editor window.  This is done with the <b>Show Breakpoints</b> command in the 
<b>Debugger</b> menu.  Once breakpoints are visible, they can be set (and 
removed) by simply clicking the mouse in the breakpoint area.  When the mouse
is over the breakpoint area, it turns into a diamond.  When the breakpoint is
set, a red diamond appears in the breakpoint area.  To remove the breakpoint,
simply click the red diamond and the breakpoint disappears.
<p> 
</p>
<center>
  <img src="turing_debugger04.gif"><br><b>Window with Two Breakpoints Set</b>
</center>
<p>
When execution reaches a line with a breakpoint on it, the program pauses
and the line is highlighted.  The program can then be resumed or stepped as
desired.  Note that it is possible to set a breakpoint on a line that is not
executed.  If you place a breakpoint on a blank line, it is quite likely that
execution will not stop.  Likewise, in lines broken over multiple lines, it
is best to put the breakpoint on the last line in the statement.
</p>
<p>
To clear all the breakpoints, select <b>Clear Breakpoints</b> from the 
<b>Debugger</b> menu.

</p>
<h2>
<a name="alloc"></a>Viewing Open Files/Pictures/Fonts, etc.</h2>
A common error in Turing programs is to neglect to close open files (using 
the <b>Close</b> statement) or free pictures or fonts (using the <b>Pic.Free</b>
or <b>Font.Free</b> procedures).  The <b>Allocated Objects</b> window displays
all allocated resources until they are freed. This window is displayed by
selecting the <b>Show Allocated Objects</b> command from the <b>Debugger</b>
menu. The command can be given even after a program has halted.  It is a
useful command to use when am <b>open</b>, Pic.New or Font.New has failed
because of too many open files, pictures or fonts.
<p>
The window will also display just how much memory each picture takes up.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<center>
  <img src="turing_debugger05.gif"><br><b>Allocated Objects Window</b>
</center>
<p>
Clicking on the line containing the allocated object will highlight the line in
the code where the object was allocated.  The headings on each of the columns
can be clicked allowing the objects to be sorted either by their ID, or by
where in the program they were allocated.
